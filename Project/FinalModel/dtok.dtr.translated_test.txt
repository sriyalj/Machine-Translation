(CS) The development of online gambling makes it possible to circumvent the laws of the Member States and to wash the money almost without any control.
We have a saying in German: Steter Tropfen höhlt den Stein (the Alatine drop undermines the stone).
We have decided to support the idea of a European Maritime Day.
The EU 2020 strategy remains very far from this.
This aspiration was a success thanks to the change that took place in the ranks of Greece, which led to a compromise solution to the name issue that was acceptable to everyone.
I would prefer a scientific approach to an emotion-based approach to animal welfare.
On behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mercosur is a reality that owes a great deal to the European Union.
In this context, it calls on the Member States to step up their efforts to improve the selection of projects in areas where there are delays and to speed up the implementation of all the projects selected in order to avoid the risk of failure to meet the agreed objectives.
As I said at the time, China needs dialogue with representatives of Tibet in order to find a solution for this autonomy, while protecting the rights of national and religious minorities in the province.
We can therefore clearly see that the situation is also deteriorating in the major emerging countries.
We have received strong assurances from the United States that they share our determination on this issue.
The point is that national heroes have usually fought against neighbouring countries.
In writing. - (FR) On the basis of Mrs Gebhardt's report, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution which decided, in accordance with the amendments, to approve the proposal for a Council regulation amending the 2003 regulation on jurisdiction and the introduction of rules on law in matrimonial matters.
However, Hungary did not hinder the accession of Romania because it took precedence over European solidarity and tolerance.
The choice of agricultural products for consumers must also be guaranteed, preventing traditional and organic crops from being contaminated by GMOs.
It would be much more difficult in the future, as it would then require a qualified majority of the representatives of the Member States to block it.
Does Turkey and the European Union have nothing more to say to each other?
The Verts / ALE, GUE / NGL and ALDE Groups wanted the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Burma to be included on Wednesday afternoon's agenda and followed by the submission of motions for resolutions.
Rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I have already presented my opinion on some things during the first stage of the negotiations.
The problem was caused by a computer system.
Moreover, a binding mechanism for settling disputes between countries will only be beneficial to the extent that it gives foreign investors the right to institute legal proceedings against the governments of the Member States of the European Union and against the Government of India at international level, while local investors will only be able to apply to their national courts.
This can only lead to unequal access to health care, within which well-identified and adequately informed citizens receive the best services provided in the European Union, while others have to accept services that are already weakened in many Member States and are certainly not improved by this directive.
We propose that you create four of the Commission's portfolio clusters or groups: External action, of course, then innovation, climate change and sustainability, then all with regard to financial and economic law and, finally, internal affairs.
The Committee on Development's proposal was to establish national reporting procedures so that transnational corporations should report on a country-by-country basis.
We have suggested a two-step decoupling approach, and I can be prepared, together with the Presidency, to take this one step, but this should be postponed until 2012, which is the last year of application, and therefore the financial year 2013 would have an impact.
First of all, I would like to tell you about the difficult situation in Poland.
It's complicated, but it's his purpose.
'Let us examine the Barnier proposals' - this is empty talk because you have kept these proposals in the file for a very long time.
The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is also similar.
I, too, am absolutely convinced of this.
It also contains specific provisions concerning economic activities in coastal areas, including construction, tourism, fishing, aquaculture and maritime activities, and instruments for integrated coastal zone management (such as environmental impact assessment, national coastal strategies and monitoring mechanisms).
Europe's leading role also means that we are imposing an obligation to reduce emissions in our 27 Member States, which we demand from other countries.
(FR) Madam President, the European Parliament and its rapporteur were forced to reject a bad compromise, which they also had reason to do.
We need people in the External Action Service who think European without losing their contacts with their home countries.
(De) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are working on today is to make the law a cross-border one.
Mr President, this is an important moment for assessing the consequences of successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, whether from the point of view of agricultural production or supply to consumers, based on the protection of self-sufficiency in foodstuffs in the Member States, ensuring an adequate amount of healthy and safe food from low prices, respecting the environment and biodiversity, and preserving the countryside and their populations, who need an adequate income and access to public services, providing them with decent living conditions.
I would remind Members that it was Ireland that put this Treaty to a democratic vote and, in the only phase in which a democratic decision was taken on the Treaty, the people rejected it.
Our aim is certainly not to lay down how to hunt; we do not intend to interfere in the hunting economy.
Any aid must be coordinated through ASEAN.
Labour inspections deal with unregistered labour force, which is a scourge for legal employment.
I hope that the decommissioning of the Arad-Szeged gas pipeline will boost not only the Nabucco gas pipeline project, but also the AGRI project, which will be used to transport gas to Europe through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Romania.
One of its advantages is a general set of rules for the determination and imposition of airport charges laying down common principles to prevent abuse of a dominant position.
I agree with the rapporteur on the need to update Council Framework Decision 2004 / 68 in order to increase the level of protection of children and make the fight against sexual exploitation more successful in general.
Right next to Europe, there is Russia and Belarus, where at the moment the same high safety standards do not apply as we do in the European Union.
This should be a matter of concern to anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens.
Your organisation, this nonsense in Parliament, should be subject to procedures so that we can actually say that we are going to be here and we can be given the floor.
Do we have any reason to believe in Russia?
Therefore, there does not seem to be a need today to draw up new legislation on the safety of nanotechnology or to propose more amendments.
It needs our help and support.
However, with regard to health, I would like to make a warning.
If the parties there are not allowed to take part in the elections, that is something that can be criticised even before the elections, because in this case the results of the elections will clearly not be able to meet democratic and European standards.
(De) Mr President, I am pleased that we have reached agreement quickly with all the groups on this important document.
The growing problem is the developing areas of cross-border banking, insurance sales and asset management, which include some very complex instruments.
The Commission's assessment powers are also well defined and limited, thus making it more, in fact, more difficult for Member States that want to continue their specific policy on foreign direct investment.
While we are talking about the recovery plan, the recovery plan, we are spending billions of euros pointlessly.
I therefore support the rapporteur's proposal that Member States should be given access to credit and loan guarantee funds, which would allow those involved in rural areas to make investments at difficult times.
I am absolutely convinced that if such a body had existed from the outset, we would have managed to coordinate our actions better, we would have known more and worked more effectively.
No, what did we just do?
However, I believe that today's key issue is that we should collect accurate data, because hospitals and clinics differ even within one country; for example, we need to know whether health-related infections are more frequent in surgical patients or in the internal disease clinic, we need to know the strain and resistance of bacteria; all these data are very important if we want to find the causes and health-related infections effectively reduced.
Many women work in research and development SMEs, whether directly or indirectly.
(De) Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns.
Thank you for your attention.
During the debate and negotiations on this decision, the difficulties which can be overcome have been institutional and geographical rather than party politics.
The Commission agrees with the honourable Member on the report on the specific benefits of the European Social Fund.
At the same time, the Commission must contribute to the industrial redevelopment of these regions by supporting financially environmentally-friendly replacement industries, renewable energies and tourism.
Pre-commercial procurement and boosting innovation for sustainable and high-quality public services in Europe (short presentation)
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 (8))
Is there a need for a formal legal framework?
These low-paid agencies are not generally needed on the labour market and can encourage the perpetuation of social inequality and undermine the reintegration of social and professional life.
This should be a new strategy that all of our countries would like to follow in order to relaunch and revitalise the EU's internal market.
Let me clarify - the Black Sea region includes EU Member States such as Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, as well as Turkey and the European Neighbourhood Policy partner, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, and the Russian Federation.
This situation in Dublin is totally at odds with the European Parliament's efforts and proposals to make the use of public transport optimum and, above all, in the urban environment.
However, as far as the issues of inclusion and integration are concerned, my idea is to make them the responsibility of the Commissioner for Social Affairs.
The Hungarian Presidency has set itself the objective of promoting refugee measures.
In view of the above situation, I propose, as has already been said, the establishment of a European Assembly (Euroeast) involving the Eastern Neighbourhood, with the participation of the European Parliament, based on the principles of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Euromed) and the European and Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EUROLAT), the aim of Euroeast is to implement the ENPI in the countries of Eastern Europe.
The collection and analysis of reliable data are crucial for supporting our work and developing effective policies and strategies.
It should be no surprise to anyone that the debate is moving to more and more modern sectors of the economy.
I would like to stress these advances, as they have been achieved through the active participation of the new Member States and not regardless of them.
Let us see how this works in practice.
In writing. - (FR) The rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, has very well analysed the challenges facing our social protection systems as a result of the ageing of the population and the decline in the active population, which seems to be close to his heart.
In writing. - (RO) We welcome Mr Ebner's report.
This figure has already risen to 80 million, in other words to 16% of the world's population.
First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the French Minister, because he was frank enough to make some extremely important statements in this House.
(CS) The overlapping and punishment of foreigners who commit violations in the European Union may be an unpopular proposal, but it is perfectly logical and practical.
It is possible that we have already exceeded the point where we have taken advantage of more than half of the world's oil reserves.
On behalf of the ECR Group. - (PL) Mr President, I believe that President Barroso is truly playing the most difficult role today.
Without financial transparency, we can never be sure who is actually behind the campaigns.
This will be followed by the second part of the sitting - questions about the employment situation in the European Union.
I have a proposal: This resolution is strict and must be strict, but there is no need to kill a sinner.
To this end, the Green Paper recommends the creation of a market-based forum for sharing knowledge between sectors and Member States.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised.
I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Services Directive and I am deeply convinced - and I often emphasise this in meetings with businesses - that it offers a huge opportunity, both for them and for the whole European economy.
Hungary did so before joining the European Union.
Bullfights and cockfights are disgusting spectacles, but the EU recognises their continuation in EU regions with an uninterrupted tradition.
When Nord Stream is finished, the same fate may be caught in my country, Poland.
Unfortunately, this important development remained at the Health Council on 8 December.
In writing. - (PL) The rapporteur has produced a very good and comprehensive report.
Supporting European social models is one of our priorities in an increasingly globalised world.
The Georgian Government must also maintain relations with the opposition and civil society.
How can you ensure that the strategy is properly implemented under these conditions?
Of course, it also deals with organised crime.
The labelling of the manufacturer's name on the food package is also important for boosting the competitiveness of the European food industry.
As we all know, the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie in Europe or in the euro area.
In other words, how transparent is its funding?
This is a fundamental, extremely important agreement that deserves the attention and support of Europe.
During my term of office as Commissioner, I have spoken with the Member States very deliberately about the problems that they are most concerned about, and I have always tried to react as soon as I notice any important problems arise.
These systems need to be introduced.
These experiences allow me to state, with full responsibility, that the decentralised model allows for better use of local potential for the implementation of strategic solutions and for desirable changes, and I therefore believe that the objectives must be agreed at European level, but the ways in which they can be achieved must be defined, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, at the most appropriate level, which is the regional and local level for cohesion policy.
At the moment, in the current crisis, everything that sends positive signals to two entities as large as Korea and the European Union must be a good thing that we want to keep trade going and want to keep trade open.
These measures will enable us to achieve much greater road safety and to ensure appropriate health and safety requirements for drivers and fair competition in the road transport sector.
The aim was to lay the foundations for a strategy to promote and guard the rights of minors in the European Union's internal and external policies and to support the Member States' struggles in this area.
I agree that we need to improve the coordination of all these issues in the European Parliament.
The use of the Structural Funds is particularly important in the context of regional policy, and I therefore believe that greater flexibility in the Structural Funds would enable us to start the programmes envisaged immediately, as their implementation would contribute to improving the economic and social situation of individual regions.
Without immediate, redundant and targeted external assistance, these 10 to 12 million people will have no chance of getting out of poverty and exclusion.
We do not consider in our discussions that the problem is urgent.
(Applause)
The EU is sending out a message that political games are decisive in the accession process, not compliance with the criteria.
These events have given hope.
As rapporteur and draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we share the same view on free business, and so we have together signed about 10 amendments, which the Council can also give its approval to.
President. - The vote is closed.
In fact, one of the main objectives of European rural policy is to ensure equal living conditions in all regions, so that even in rural areas, men and women can seize the opportunity to build something.
We encourage them to buy as many local food as possible.
(Applause)
Once again, we see that these free trade agreements seek to force through the window what did not come through the door.
This, too, is very important for some in the Chamber.
As Mr De Gucht and I have already mentioned, we are trying to find a balance.
The decisions taken by Parliament and the Council in 2006 to establish the 'Youth in Action' programme and the Lifelong Learning programme have, in principle, already promised the participation of Switzerland.
It's the system.
When we talk about training and education, the strategy for sustainable development now requires us to look at them through the prism of climate change and environmental progress.
The summit will take place this Thursday in Prague.
The economic and financial crisis that Europe is experiencing must be seen as an opportunity to adopt measures that not only help Member States recover, but also increase people's awareness of more sustainable behaviour.
We must do everything in our power to help.
With this in mind, the question arises as to how to maintain biodiversity within the framework of intensive economic and infrastructure development.
We prefer general questions about the crisis and its overcoming.
Mr President, honourable Members, the new directive shows the Union's determination to give decisive aid to European businesses, and especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to overcome the economic crisis, which the Commission intends to achieve with a number of measures.
Who are we?
I find this strange.
The other amendments emphasised the need to strengthen the management and monitoring of fisheries resources, as well as the need for responsible consumption, and stated that fish is a natural resource limited in number, which means that there are limits to fishing, export and consumption.
The sales practices in use do not allow an increase in the cost of production, including oil, to be expressed in the price of fish, due, inter alia, to the current import policy.
European research has produced results and these results must now be implemented through both national and regional policies.
As far as the Commission is concerned, support for health care systems remains a priority in our foreign policy and is an important part of our political dialogue with third countries.
Turkey's accession negotiations started on 3 October 2005, but the country has achieved only a few progress so far.
The European Union must therefore learn from this crisis and implement the initiatives adopted in all areas and coordinate its joint actions with the Member States.
For the most part, the main points of the report two years ago have been included in the new report and have been further developed.
In the course of this process, we could see how the bottom-up initiative helped both cases to analyse and shape the instruments.
In fact, the fight against rogue and exploited employers should be fought and, at that time, what we need is an action plan to support employees rather than an action plan against immigrants.
He told me he got stuck in traffic.
The way to punish is not always the best.
There are many examples where the Commission, the Member States or the beneficiaries can do so in order to improve the situation in agriculture, for example.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur for his good work.
We should not rush the proposal for the organisation of new elections, because we must ensure an action plan aimed at democratic reforms.
This increases Parliament's options; it does not restrict the rights of any Member.
This leaves the European institutions with an important task of inviting Russian leaders to take into account the vital non-material aspect of real social modernisation: The preservation of fundamental rights in a free civil society.
Nevertheless, there are fears that the work programme presented by the Electoral Commission in July 2007 will not be completed in due time.
This is happening in Slovakia, where, in addition, Mr Slota says the problem is that they have failed to get rid of Hungarians in their own country and that it is a source of all these problems.
We need to do more to ensure that the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy takes the same pace in all Member States, because if there is a slower trend in one Member State, it also affects others.
As far as we can tell, the consumption is restored.
A revised timetable has now been agreed, which is actually more demanding than the original Commission proposal, but, at the same time, leaves sufficient time for appropriate action at every stage.
The role of the members of the Works Council in the process of informing and consulting employees should be laid down more clearly.
This resolution also guarantees the protection of refugees and migrants.
We must name things with the right names, because Putin's Russia is where Hitler's Germany was in the middle of the 1930s.
In order for these fine words and the main objectives to become a reality and to avoid the collapse of the so-called common delusions of the Lisbon Strategy this time, it is very important that we give ourselves the resources we need to act.
That's how things should go, but it won't.
I agree that the reimbursement of costs will depend on the prior authorisation of well-founded and predetermined cases, i.e. when, within the framework of a cross-border healthcare service, the patient has to remain in hospital for at least one night, where it requires the use of highly specialised and expensive medical devices, or where this involves a special risk for the patient or the population.
We must continue to put pressure on our international partners to implement the existing G20 commitments in a timely and coherent manner and on an equal footing.
I, as an agricultural politician, learnt from the start of these negotiations when I opened the newspapers.
We have put the issue on the agenda of the IGF and we will soon propose a renewed plan on protecting children from the dangers of the Internet.
This is not democracy.
However, it appears that, in addition to the stated objectives of principle, such as increasing the speed of Internet access and bringing citizens up with new technologies, there are some very difficult objectives to achieve in the action plan.
I will never forget how your two children, your daughter and your son looked for me a few years ago, when I was in a different role, and how they stood up for their mother.
This requires the financial support we provide.
Unfortunately, the conflict in Gaza may have negative consequences in relation to regional support and the issues of the peace process.
What is described as the Annapolis process must not be used as a smokescreen, behind which the settlement policy remains, and the Palestinian territories continue to be segregated by numerous security zones, which hinder the free movement of people.
This idea is rooted in the negotiations on the Bali Action Plan.
That makes us look ridiculous.
The report also states that Member States should put an end to cuts in the budget for health services.
This system does not need to be amended in order to enhance the re-use of raw materials.
I think that we would have reached a first-reading agreement even if we had not gone through this process.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection commissioned a study which showed that online gambling has the same harmful effects as the usual playground managed by a national lottery company.
(Et) Madam President, the decision to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument shows the success of institutional cooperation and confirms once again that the European institutions consider funding for the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan to be essential.
But it didn't happen.
There may be a different situation in Sweden, because there are large reserves of hydropower, but there are none in Poland.
Before we take action, we must have arguments and conclusions from experts.
All improvements to the Euro-Mediterranean agreements will have a major impact on the economic and political stability of countries, encouraging countless social and democratic benefits.
Almost every one of us is involved in one way or another in the field of tourism.
I hope, like my colleagues, that in the coming weeks all the Member States will unreservedly sign and comply with this agreement because, as you well know, there is talk about whether, with the leadership of the United States or with inspiration from them, some countries, many of whom are also Member States, intend to circumvent the agreement by twisting (if so) the definition of cluster munitions and by insisting on its lesser possibility of accidental damage to those affected by the unexploded parts.
I have mentioned the declaration made on 15 June last year, in which the United States and the European Union committed themselves to working to strengthen human rights and to combat terrorism.
This has been made quite clear by previous speakers.
The state is independent when its authorities are exclusive.
This is already the case with the rules applicable to the divorce of spouses from different countries.
The TACs comply with the catch rules under the scheme, and I am pleased to see that this proposal already helps us manage the stocks properly.
This is the reason why, in June 2008, the Council decided to repeal the diplomatic measures in 2003 in order to promote political dialogue and to allow the full use of the instruments corresponding to the common position of 1996.
This issue really falls within the competence of the Member States, even though the Union must obviously avoid any discrimination against citizens belonging to minorities.
We have already seen how the rules relating to liquids set a precedent, making additional security measures in airports the norm Anything uncomfortable, however, these rules on liquids for passengers, under no circumstances constitute interference in private life.
We can dance through the area of budgetary control at European level, but, as long as the Member States do not dance, it can never be a performance worthy of a prize.
As various people have said, missions are not cheap, so if we are to carry out further missions, we also need an additional budget.
The budgetary procedure is long and difficult, which is contrary to what Mr Lewandowski said in the French press in anticipation of the position of MEPs.
Thank you.
At that time, it was already a long and technically complex document, regulating customs matters in the Community.
I would like to start by saying that I think it is very important that, in the implementation phase of the White Paper, sport should remain at the heart of the European policy on volunteering, which is in the general interest, without any request for profit.
Worse still, the report advocates the abuse of power, using the simplified revision procedure of the Treaty of Lisbon to try and avoid a possible referendum.
If these tracks do not belong to a variety which has an EU occupation, they shall not be allowed to unload the shipment.
Many of our citizens question the added value of the European Union in their everyday lives.
However, on the basis of the data for 2005, it can be seen that the US has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.4%, while the EU is approaching the Kyoto target and 2005 issued a total of 7.9% less than in the 1990s.
Mr President, we have clear expectations of the Council and the Commission.
Given Europe's ever-ageing population, this figure could double in the next few decades.
I would also like to take the liberty of reminding you that reducing dependence on imports of fossil fuels remains an important political objective.
- After the vote on paragraph 1:
This development also extends Europol's area of activity and adds to its competence all acts punishable.
However, there is still a lire in the north.
Two other institutions joined us: The Commission and the Council.
All this should be clarified before the legislative process is started.
The Commission and the Council Secretariat shall also participate in the European consular cooperation.
The stories we have heard from the people who have recently visited the region are terrible and, as I said, we must do everything we can to try and alleviate the human misery that we are experiencing at the moment.
As you can imagine, the indication of the country of origin is undoubtedly one of the priorities and main points of our work.

Perhaps the Commission's proposal will improve slightly in the course of further negotiations.
Therefore, the macro-financial assistance that is now being allocated must provide further evidence of the approach and solidarity of Ukraine towards this country at a time when it is exceptionally weak socially, economically and financially.

In today's world, where conflicts also take place in the trade spill, the protection of our foreign investment companies must become a priority.
Informing investment projects in energy infrastructure will help to define the gaps between demand and supply in this sector, and thus also to develop a better common energy policy based on solidarity, bringing the Member States closer together in the energy market.

We need a more cohesive democratic alliance offered by Lisbon in order to cope with many of the challenges that everyone could encounter in our world: Energy security, climate change, the economic and financial crisis and many wars in many regions.
The resolution clearly mentions and expressly criticises the measures taken by the current government, but forgets that the current mayor of Naples, IerCommissioners, is part of the centre-left and, worse still, forgets the long term of government of Bassolino as mayor of Naples in 1993-2000 and as governor of Campania in 2000-2010, as well as several years as the special commissioner for the waste crisis.
There are some paragraphs in the text adopted that I believe are decisive for undeclared work, which is so widespread: We are talking about 20% of Europe's gross domestic product.
Other messages have also been sent: From small shops in the UK, who have made great efforts over the last two years to apply the HACCP principles and are proud to have succeeded.

The chairman of the committee, Mrs Berès, has already said that during this period - particularly since 1994, when the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty began until 2002 - Parliament cooperated actively on the introduction of banknotes and coins, as well as on the preparation of numerous reports, discussions, opinions and proposals, and I would like to thank, in particular, the two chairmen of the committee, Karl von Wogau and Chriszita Rando-Plath, who also represented the European Parliament in the world at that time. You gave the necessary parliamentary support to this enterprise, which was originally from governments.
Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Gualtieri whether it has occurred to him that intergovernmental cooperation would be a better way for the peoples of Europe and for the unemployed than a European superstate, which he seems to be advocating?
The debate is closed.
(It) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against dumping is one of the most specific tools for protecting commercial dignity in the European Union in order to compete fairly on the market.

He is undoubtedly the President who is looking more at Moscow than at Brussels.

It is totally unacceptable that, for weeks, we are told that we would enter into war with the WTO so that, as Mr De Gucht told us, we would not be able to sell aeroplanes again so that we would no longer be able to sell anything if we took this decision, while the opposite is expressed in a legal opinion.
Secondly, when we realised this, it was the Council that, for a long time, refused to take the necessary measures, which were actually introduced in the Stability and Growth Pact, and to impose the necessary sanctions.
(BG) Mr President, I would like to join the majority opinion expressed in the Chamber and I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the achievements contained in his report.

- It's really gonna happen again now, isn't it?
I found it.
A tiny, filthy little monkey with an evil eye.
Actually, bring it to me.
You know what, Jerry?
- I don't know.
Ali, you're taking Nikki's place.
Like cooking.
Abigail has a very good girl.
Hey!
No peanuts.
Stop it.
You always had to hide the bruises?
Tonight's main characters:
I never asked you to deal with me.
I'm asking for an Acme police number in Mexico.
Go.
Is this guy bothering you?
Take and take this good soup to my lovely husband.
So that's what it is.
I don't want anything.
And the machine is mined.
I haven't felt the smell since I was working on the docks.
How dare you?
It must be hard to keep track.
- Goodbye, Andrew.
I think I knew him.
If the rainy season continues, squirrels change their eating habits.
He was three out of ten.
Biological weapons, but there was an accident...
How can I be calm when Pullo made that little witch spy on me?
Look at you!
Start searching the bars in New Orleans.
Oh, here it is.
Whatever!
After a little stop, he'll make it to the hotel as another person.
"To see the world in sand blades... and heaven in wild flowers... to keep eternity in their hands... and eternity in one hour."
- Look.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tell me the truth, Jill, do you see a man in him?
Even if it doesn't turn out to be bad, the army will still quarantine this place.
Everything I've done will affect my family.
You didn't see that move coming?
You'd have stabbed anyone else right now!
Mr. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm--
- Let's go, Dobbs.
All right, let's start here.
Yogi!
It's... so beautiful.
But your uncle believed in you, and so did I.
They're the DNA men, right?
Not for a while.
Why?
Do it, too.
And yes, I will keep my mouth shut.
- It's yellow.
- No.
One of you is going after him.
And by the way, he only did it to protect you from the drama of his family, which is further proof that he likes you.
I really hope that
Attention, there's a visitor.
Has he ever had any behavioural problems since he changed his diet?
Different moths, different pheromones.
But if we join together, we will have courage, we will be able to achieve justice.
We're on our way, General.
Don't move!
Houston, do you copy?
Let's go.
Lesson two:
- Egotistical?
I don't need it, but...
- No.
His father's been unemployed for seven years.
Thank God.
He was a lunatic in the church of Baptisti on 12th Street, until he said he couldn't stand the cradle of evil.
Confirm, this is Squid Killer.
You can keep entertaining yourself with that idea.
Did you hear that?
Do whatever you want.
It's Sunday.
People write songs about going out of L.A. 's roads.
Now we can laugh at each other because we're partners now.
No, it's slowing down the work of our entire department.
Don't leave us with the light.
- Something's gotta be important.
All right, give me a minute.
I'm about to lose my battery.
All I know is I was in a syringe, and now I'm in you.
- Good morning, miss.
Right now, people believe that it's crazy emissions, but that attitude is changing.
It's against the law.
It's not a surprise, but it's still a disappointment.
Does his mother know about this?
Does that seem too much of a dodge?
I think he's...
I want you to marry me!
I think we got our killer.
What?
OO, big words from a computer freak's sissy.
Ingmar...
I should give him a break.
Romney.
- I don't get a clear answer.
No!
Somebody help him!
Like a machine gun?
Oh, that's a shame.
They're saved.
All right, all right.
I mean, they can sing, they can dance, they can even clean later.
Yeah, Danny.
- Hey, baby!
I don't understand how karate makes me a better health companion.
Kill them all!
I said no, thank you.
My coach, my accountant...
What a surprise.
We don't have any more clean water.
Not all of them.
Do you have anything else to say in conclusion?
Then we'll have a big TV with two pulls.
Yeah, yeah.
- I was the first.
Say it louder.
We can't stay here.
I'll bet you the car.
Is there one on me?
You can blow up the whole block like that.
- What do you want?
Hey!
A day or two after that, you ask me to take the suitcase so I can cut off your arm.
You hit me in the face, remember?
Maybe at first, but you'd get used to it.
Who was that?
He's done worse.
- Of course I do.
Did you like dinner?
So if I happen to know exactly where he is, I should go and jeopardize my life to save that little rat son's life?
- Kind and pretty.
Shut up.
Sounds like a void.
We need those backup cylinders down here.
This year, I gave my best friend a very good gift.
I emptied the floor and added a couple of modern comforts.
The first survivor is on board.
- It's a habit, you know?
If I have to die, it's my honor and glory, not yours.
Charlotte's here.
You didn't go half back in the garden.
I'm not blowing up the plant.
I'm not leaving Uncle Cyrus with a voicemail.
All right, I'll be right there.
There's no riddle, no intrigue.
Okay.
One time, during the operation.
Still, I don't have anything to cut it with.
Now he understands.
- Good day.
Awesome!
Okay.
- I'm unrecognizable.
I've been chasing this son of a bitch for 10 years.
I think I could be a little more hospitable, especially since I myself have suffered the same misery.
Joey, you made me realize you needed some space.
Give me your hand.
- Well, what now?
I understand.
Well, Berlin, I'm Nolan.
Look at this, a real pile of junk.
Hello?
- Oh, my God, Clark!
Broyles.
As long as you bring it to me.
YZX, it's all clear up to 10500, there's no traffic.
So I got a shot for fun?
Does my wife use the word "soul"?
His situation makes him look for the Wraith.
I need a residence permit, too.
A waitress found me next to the diner in a trash can.
No.
Let them leave everything they have to me.
Shall we go?
- Good answer.
I'd really like to see it.
We can't have Crais near these monsters.
I can hear you.
- And crying about it.
- I've been asking for hours.
My father.
Nemetes!
Jimmy?
They did it.
Is the swamp better?
What are you doing?
Like witches.
- I'll be there soon.
What about McCrane?
It's coming.
My name is Benjamin Carson.
Well, you can cry me in the river
In about two weeks, the infection should kill 25% of the world's population.
- But you're 22 now.
But he listens to you.
Yeah?
Good luck to you, too.
I'm listening.
He reads people, senses vulnerability.
You're all right.
- You can't see anything in the dark.
An antique talisman with mysterious abilities.
How are you holding up?
Wait a minute.
Thank you, Robin.
Yeah.
Now you have a decision to make about whether this is right for you.
I love Jesse.
The camera looks like he's got a locked hole in your family bathroom.
Oh, my God, Prue...
I'll give you Mona's number, and you can call her when it suits you.
Have you ever heard of the Special Weapons Group?
This guy's gonna get ugly.
Louie.
Are you sure about this?
Put your hands up!
Ladies.
Changpu.
These are the best in the state.
It's all good with certain foods.
I'd like to get down a little.
Where did we get this?
He's very young and he drinks too much.
Platoon, attention!
- No, they're not done yet.
After that, I haven't taken it out in front of a woman.
Except you?
Hey, guys, let's beat the bitches!
What did these guys want?
Nokes will report to Driscoll.
First-class pancakes.
- You're a beautiful boy!
He's going to have a new hips next week.
Do you know anything about cloning?
No, you just look completely unusual.
Kirk, you've been on ten dates and you can't get a deal in a bag?
One day, they put a bomb in his car.
Aren't you, sweetheart?
It's gonna be okay.
- No.
Oh, my God.
There's a group of older enlighteners.
I'll help you.
What do you mean?
I kept away from the drugs.
- Why are they acting like that?
Do you hear voices sometimes?
Honey, you!
See you, jerks!
"Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines."
I asked you a question at my house, but I didn't get an answer.
Mad at a former employee?
Hey, guys!
Come on.
Glitch, fig, mike, tall.
Whatever.
I think you should show this to Ramey.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
Come on, I'm buying.
At least leave me your number.
If you want to do something right, start with our kids.
He calls you at any time.
What was that?
The holy truth of all the Indian adventure lies only in one sentence:
Are you saying I killed those people?
Why would the government kidnap the Green Arrow?
- $140!
- Call an ambulance!
- They've been fighting each other for centuries.
Is that why you didn't listen to Rene?
I have to be pathetic.
Let's go.
Come on!
- Bye.
I have a sample for every year, but I doubt the general can try them all.
A blow.
He risked his life and Brecca's life to satisfy his ambition and pride.
Lana, I really didn't expect all of this.
My mom doesn't even talk to me.
These shrimp are good and fresh.
It happened on August 12 in Sheep's Meadows.
There's nothing out there but shame and hate.
- Are you interested?
Hey!
Don't worry.
"Send Dr. Zola over to Switzerland?"
Don't worry.
Only then, no one can hurt you.
- Nice handwriting.
Are you a cop?
Captain Tanner, you flew on six shuttle missions.
I'm fine.
We're expanding the search area.
Like here?
We didn't know about your meeting.
I don't know, Clinton.
They're on their way.
Frog's breath dampens every smell.
Things didn't go exactly as planned.
You have to go to church with the candles of the Virgin Mary.
It's right here in Washington Hospital.
Edmunds!
Yeah.
No.
You know how much they'd pay for this?
Good job, White.
Nothing?
He's been dating the hospital for ten months.
Good job.
You were dead.
A special place to call yours.
- It's all right.
He saved me from poverty.
- The place was free.
I'm not telling you to stop doing this.
Why are you running?
I need to call Stitch.
I'm not gonna let you in a teacher's room or school.
My mother liked to share with me the songs she liked in her youth.
- He was min...
Mika's dead.
I'm totally....
- We'll find out.
Anyway, it's an animal patrol area.
But that's what we've been trying for over an hour.
The transmitter.
He said he took a train to Portland work every day, but his car always left the station.
That's Katie?
Calm down!
Let's go.
Yes!
- He can handle himself.
But the rest of you, that's the end of my story.
What do you think of that?
Leland?
Is it, and we'll all see.
The air above us is made up of several layers, and now I have a chance to see what they're doing.
- Yes, I do.
- No, it's an elevator.
Nicholas?
That fucking shiane needed a first move, but I couldn't get it in.
Listen, you know what, there's a cold beer in the fridge and there's clean sheets in bed.
But that speech was the complete opposite of Fresh Prince's speech.
We've been trying to reach your parents.
I know, I...
Not Jen.
From an old fart like that who has a broomstick up his ass?
What's weird is that you're a priest and you sleep on the couch instead of sleeping as a man in bed next to him.
Commander.
He felt really bad when he was expelled, but he deserved it.
What happened to us?
I could be John Wakefield's daughter.
We got a saying at Bay City:
Maren's a hot woman.
- Opened at the moment of birth.
I knew you'd come back.
It'll take you straight to the street.
All right.
Is it possible it could lead to another pot?
What's your big plan, Elena?
- Good.
- That's all right.
It was from Herb's office.
Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you were good at bowling,
We got a call from the Boston Police Department.
He would have done the same thing.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
Remember my face... and you will get your revenge in your next life!
If we're so disgusting to you, we'll break it.
No, Nina!
- We're donating money right now.
No, no, no, no more bad news from you!
- Ma'am, are you ready?
Thanks for telling me, Brian.
Oceano Restaurant.
Straight to Instagram!
General Hammond, I'd rather die than give out any information on this world.
Hiccup, quick.
You had no right to spy in my lab.
No movie, either.
I can't find my money.
Violet!
Philippe!
I'm not stupid.
- Why not?
You're angry about what I said about Maryann.
- Boy!
I'm sorry.
The carbins are for protection.
I can't confirm that.
Make up with Lisa.
After the orphanage, I was alone, and Caesar was one of the boys I ran around with.
How's your sister?
Military technology.
You're back.
This has been a problem a long time ago.
Cara, John, where are you?
I thought you were dying.
Do you like it?
Nice to meet you.
It's pretty simple.
If there's any chance this guy is Tully's secret weapon, we're gonna need a lot more than his high school grade!
No, not you.
You deserve to know that.
One I'll attend this night.
My mother lied to everyone.
I'll call you later!
No, Ferdl takes care of the technical side.
We would very much like to hear more about your order.
Tell me what's wrong.
He's back here.
I'll also give you a bag of methamphetamine.
I know it's tempting, but...
I'm a regular Chinese man...
I'll see you in a little while.
You shoot me, my leg comes from a clutch.
What are you doing?
No, no one but me can finish this.
I told you you could have a stroke.
It's considered a public challenge to me!
It's okay.
And once they are worn... people will be able to understand the size of our time... because of what you, my Leader, mean to Germany!
Sometimes I remember being just a machine.
Okay, I got it.
Daddy.
Johnny, I've given you some breathing space because when I watch you dance, I'm gonna get fiercely hard, just like a lot of other people.
Now the cavalry is rushing over our children.
It's disturbing.
I'm very sorry, sir.
Remember?
- Come on.
- And that'll be three pounds.
He misses you.
I'm trying.
- I can tell Pete the truth.
Viktor!
Hey, Bo.
Relationships are work.
♪ Or another unfulfilled dream?
I want to meet you.
Who are you?
I promised you I wouldn't do anything without your permission.
Run!
Why don't you try a fairer rhythm?
- Do we have a mother?
It's just a thought of something bad that could happen.
No!
It's celluloid propaganda.
I mean, I don't think so.
"God's breath Only a man who regrets sin shall pass."
So what are you shitting for, man?
My days are numbered in the FBI.
Rib in sharp sauce.
I'll wait.
Let's just say that.
But you didn't call me back.
I've been following a blind man.
45 minutes of CSIs, and I already know what's going on.
I don't know how to say it, but you touched something about me.
Nostradamus is trying to scare us to stop the ocean from rising, to stop its children from starving, to stop the climate from getting out of control.
- Shut up.
- Oh, he's real.
You can come every day, but do we have to keep fighting about the suitcase?
I don't know you.
No.
He put everything on paper.
Again.
How can you win if I don't fight?
I have no idea.
- I found them all but Mr. Henderson.
- September 15.
Where are you going?
But he can be stopped.
Lawton, he's not answering.
That's how we get more people.
I didn't want our last conversation to be remembered for the last conversation.
You're not.
Isn't that what you wanted, Winter?
Someone's paying attention.
What's wrong with everyone?
Laurie, pick up the fucking phone.
In the closet.
- So they know something about explosives?
You see what I have to endure!
Hey!
I think one of the blue wires has been disconnected.
I think Beethoven has a girlfriend.
Pushkin.
Retreat!
The lights...
I think that's why I'm going on this trip.
Are you all right, sweetheart?
There's a list.
Not us, Liz.
The sickness will convince you that you don't have it.
However, I am convinced that child abductions have a great future.
There's a new one up there, man.
Outside the party?
Lorenzo, close your eyes.
There he is.
- Excuse me.
Can you say "Alecko"?
Is that public administration?
- I'll see what I can find.
Yes, sir.
Nine more months to go...
No grapes.
I'd choose words if I were you, traitor.
- Calm down!
Sentimental.
We're down here.
I've decided to share your food and drink.
I'm not fighting you, the only thing to do is shoot!
Nice!
You already have.
I don't think it's lunch.
Exactly.
They'd start flying in first class, staying at an exclusive 5 star hotel where they'd spend their days at the pool and making love to the night.
When we're done here, let's see if we can find clean clothes.
I'm not unhappy.
I like your hair, like Stamos.
Walt's with your husband...
Then we kill him.
It's like they have the right to condemn us.
Apparently, a small world.
You're just gonna make a little opening so the air can get out.
A magnificent combination of fear and squandering, passion and shape.
Because what follows is hopefully beyond your imagination.
Nothing.
We don't discuss our own business with adults.
On his way?
And then flirting with the opposite sex of work... then, unfortunately, you get pregnant, a fast wedding, and you live in luck.
Only the facts, no other things.
Heads up, gentlemen.
Just once.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Yeah, we really are.
I think I know why Dom's here.
- no ice in the cognac.
- No!
You want protection?
Where's my cell phone?
In case you change your mind.
- For old times' sake?
He turned your finger around, Ted.
I told you we all wanted to get a whip, but we don't have time for this.
You thought you had it all figured out, Fish?
No doubt.
I own the Sixth Rainbow City.
Where is he?
He's a distraction.
Excuse me, Mr. Rethrick.
Why?
Oh, my goodness.
I'll check.
You can't tell an old man.
What I'm asking is simple.
He wants to take control of his collective.
I'm not ready to build a home.
That's ridiculous.
This could be a waste of time for someone else.
Yeah.
What have I done?
I'm not like the others, I'm not involved in your war.
I heard.
Local police arrested the owner of the club.
- That would mean a lot of problems at the same time.
You said you believed in me, but you lied!
Did you work at Grimaldi's wedding?
Smile!
- Mass murder?
I'm sorry, I know he was your friend.
Because you're not putting pressure on her from the right place.
Are you kidding me?
They're all dead.
Hey, you got a cornflake...
Cool!
I knew you'd sell your mother for the whale of Etruski, and I didn't know you'd sell your land and soul to mankind.
You're too young for this!
That you scanned my eggs for kidnapping DRN from the hospital and causing damage in millions of dollars.
April 19th, 3: 00 to be exact.
Can you reach the window of the roof?
Its blade is valyrian steel, pipe dragon.
Because you're the same.
You talked to Blanche?
Don't let your nose down, Carson.
You're torturing yours?
No, it's not.
- He was an accomplice.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
You two aren't...
Drinks for all 100.
Do you see a trembling tattooed thing that buys grass at 3: 00 in the morning?
A normal life doesn't suit me, but when I drink wine in the ocean or spend time with a beautiful stranger, I feel like myself.
Some time earlier this year, maybe towards the end of January, this climb (master samurai) named Motome Chijiiwa came to visit, and his visit was the same as yours.
Easy, you just have to...
I recognized you from the file.
And you know what else?
This war is all nothing.
But you need to calm down, okay?
Are you kidding me?
What do we do?
I made Jell-O myself, and...
Everyone inside was killed.
Dear Brooklyn Boy,
Ready.
No one lives there, and no one goes there, and fishing in there is awful good.
I'll take care of them.
We have organs, but there's no money.
I did everything you told me to do.
All right.
Even if you don't want to.
Yeah.
Alpha, Zulu, 4-2-5
By the way, Claire works for me.
Looks empty today.
If I ask my father who could become of me, he has no idea.
Did he say tasty condoms?
- That's all right.
What is... a kiss?
They're assholes.
Press the number one and then the green one.
Come on.
One dinner.
The warden said the price has risen.
- Excellent.
- Good to see you again.
I don't want to decide to the detriment of your client, but I don't see how, given the facts, I could do differently.
Your parents, the dean, or your wife?
Where are we going?
- You wanna see what I can do
Liu Jinx, what kind of man are you?
Your character, your clothes and your address.
But maybe they're in the garden.
He's been hiding somewhere.
It's in Marin.
No.
The beautiful Coomb county is at 8: 00, and once again, the cops have refused to comment on this striped light game seen in the local sky.
It's too dangerous.
You can't pass it.
Admirable.
Do you know anything about this?
What was that?
Welcome to the club.
So whatever you want, do it yourself.
Did he know who my mother had given birth to me?
Nice guy.
All right.
Shame on you for rushing it.
If you didn't say anything, it might have just gone by.
I just gave it back to him.
What if we all voted for him, funny, and he won?
He's fine.
Let the drinks stay.
I'm Jim Lovell, and this transmission is coming to you, 320 000 kilometers high, and we promise you a good show.
Cities were burned, youth rebelled, the President's obsolete, the leaders were killed.
Have a good day,
That means Sidney Bernstein.
It's not because of Jenna, it's because...
Yep.
You've been very friendly and very kind.
I'm gonna die.
No more talking about hurting the baby.
- He can turn us all in.
(Grunts) (gasps)
I sent Masuka to Tilden's house to search for evidence of the murder that took place there.
I'm getting used to it.
It's a safe location.
When the curtain rises, I rise.
- Perfect big place?
These people.
I keep it for a special occasion.
Get in the car, Hooch.
Yes, it is.
That's your assignment.
Caroline went to school early.
That's not the point.
You'll take it as a symbol of your intention to stay sober.
No, it's okay, it's tradition.
This is Megrez.
That's my opinion.
Really?
Palms up, like you're holding a pizza.
When I was at Tom and Myrtle's secret apartment, madness grabbed us.
Look, you got the fish!
I can't keep it open forever, Juni.
An address?
Damn.
Two snakes with emerald eyes.
- Shut up!
He cut his head off.
So I think I'm doing him a favor.
So when the cool is done with Angelo, we can be too?
Maybe your girlfriend knows.
Ernie.
I'm a butler at Darlington Manor, and my employer is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.
Are you capable of doing this?
I know about death, Winston.
- That's your reaction?
Come on.
I pledged it to Fellman.
Your father will be avenged.
Did you like that car?
You have to open it.
No problem with that, talk to me!
You, too.
Keep pulling.
Well, I don't think you're strong enough to tell me what to do in my own hotel room.
What are you saying?
Was it fun?
It'll be forever.
When did this MacArthur get used to you?
Now you're here to tell me how everything is fine.
Why is he here?
Come on, come on.
It's Friday night.
- Honey.
Please, Warren.
-... then carry on...
He's gone now.
Isn't that right, honey?
You're young for such a position.
Ste!
Hey, baby.
Don't let me down.
I think I've counted the civilian ships before I left.
That's why?
Don't tell me.
I don't like him.
Can't you see Dad wants to sleep?
Why is Scorpius still in Chrichton's mind?
Intelligence says they'll be flying close to us, and then we'll hit them.
Welcome, Billy.
Where's your lieutenant?
In the meantime, hide them in your basement.
What, robbing a bank?
She said Tyler had nothing to do with your guns.
Very classy.
- Sergeant Landers!
What do you mean?
- I'm about to get to it...
Look.
Go ahead, Kahn.
