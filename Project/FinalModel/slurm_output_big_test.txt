on behalf of the EF@@ D Group . - Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Barroso : why do we not rush so badly ?
of course , the Commission does not need a remin@@ der that it needs to monitor compliance with the Treaty .
we will vote for good and against bad , and we will not be subjected to black@@ mail .
firstly , there are many promises in the plan about how the European Union is being used to build a better economy in order to solve the climate problem and other issues , but there is nothing about the problems that the EU has itself created - problems in the labour markets , problems in fisheries , in the economy , in the fight against crime , and so on .
these requirements are very clear and transparent .
these are not political issues .
we 're on the right track .
the EU 's position there is clear : we want to maintain the effectiveness of our measures and , at the same time , protect our businesses against other protection@@ ist practices .
China must be forced to comply and respect international standards of human rights .
further development is important , particularly through a multi@@ discip@@ lin@@ ary approach involving social research into the welfare of patients and their families , as well as through the promotion of healthy lif@@ es@@ ty@@ les for brain activity , and through a significant improvement of the general living conditions and health status of the population .
last Wednesday , we voted in favour of the revised framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission , which provides for Parliament 's new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon .
it is important to ensure that this 30 % continues to buy newspa@@ pers every day .
( de ) Madam President , Commissioner , we view the Single European S@@ ky as the most important project for the future of air transport .
it also does not eliminate the main problem of the occurrence of obe@@ sity and obe@@ si@@ ty-@@ related diseases in the wider population , which is directly due to the imbalance in energy input and output due to the lack of physical movement .
for our part , we also support the Si@@ x@@ th Agreement mentioned by Mr B@@ ü@@ ti@@ ko@@ fer , and we are grateful that a number of speakers have commen@@ ded the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency , which , as the Hungarian Presidency , has made it a priority to address this issue .
co@@ stly administration , delays in payments and difficult checks on the eligibility of payments give rise to financial difficulties for the final beneficiaries .

in my opinion , the best way of realis@@ ing this report is for the EU to encourage innovation and technological development rather than putting obstacles to regulation in the way .
your earlier actions will send you as a shadow and are related to people who have never given up lying to stamp their political op@@ pon@@ ents as dangerous .
this is the third proposal that has been put forward .
however , this does not seem to be the case for the cross-border retail financial services market .
however , in order to contribute to democratic development , the Council also extended the suspension of restrictive measures .
Mr President , does he really think it is right to vote in favour of regulations that actually raise the price of vehicles ?
we should not sacrifice the potential of research for private gain .
it is therefore very important that we focus on training and education in Europe , as well as on infrastructure and research .
let me remind you all of this commitment and , in particular , the President of the Commission and the Commissioner , who have a major responsibility in this .
there was also a conference on the situation of the European Union , and I met with students from the European Uni@@ versity Institute .
I hope that the Moldo@@ van parliamentary elections on 28 November will enable Moldova to continue to develop .
as a result of the recent economic crisis , doubts have ari@@ sen as to the stage at which the internal market is now : there are people who claim that the internal market is weak at the moment .
this initiative was very war@@ mly welcomed by all those who had been waiting for it for the last 30 years - yes , 30 years .
the work of the Assembly and , in particular , the opportunities it provides for the creation of direct links between MEPs from both sides , also strength@@ ens the sense of the Union 's presence in the most remote regions of Africa , the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean and the Pacific .
Mr De@@ pre@@ z has found the right words , the voice of balance and reason ; he supports an open Europe , and I welcome that .
we must avoid this .
in the meantime , as I have already said , we will have to cope with the handling of the past heritage , both for some of the countries you are aware of and what we have in the programme - such as Greece and Ireland - and for other countries where we will take measures to prevent them from entering this programme .
this is not at all compatible with the European Union 's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , which must actually be increased to 30 % if others join .
Mr President , I hope that our Commissioner will have his vote back , because we need it at the Canc@@ ún climate conference .
do I have to say I was loud in protest !
on the second question from the honourable Member , I would like to say that the negotiations on the framework are still under way , so I cannot give you any numbers .
( de ) Madam President , Commissioner , both Parliament , the Commission and the Council agree that the CAP budget must be proper and at least remain at the current level .
the report on inter-@@ regional cooperation between the European Union and Latin America and the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean , presented by the Joint Presidency at the last meeting of the fourth summit in Vien@@ na , is proof of the important progress achieved so far in the actual implementation of the commitments made .
the general safety regulation will make electronic stability control systems mandatory for all vehicles and , in the case of heavy goods vehicles , a high level of emergency bra@@ king systems and al@@ er@@ ts warning systems .
the major problems were in the Fre@@ th@@ un Ra@@ il@@ way Department in the north of France , thereby also affecting the operation of the La Man@@ che Tun@@ nel until additional security measures were introduced in 2002 .
we will also raise these issues in the consultations on human rights held twice a year .
that is why , Madam President , provided that the conditions they have to meet for assistance are clearly defined , all the countries in the world with which the European Union cooper@@ ates and who are in a serious pre@@ car@@ ious situation should be able to rely on an exceptional system which ensures rapid and effective intervention .
approval of this resolution is the first and inevi@@ table step towards greater participation by European citizens .
therefore , the Tri@@ o of Presid@@ encies of the European Union , consisting of Spain , Belgium and Hungary , must strengthen the social Europe by creating jobs and improving the living conditions of European citizens .
the time has now come to re@@ vise the future of this programme without for@@ getting the bigger picture .
I must say that I am pleased to see you , Minister , and I hope that we will see more next year , and you will be free to start answ@@ ering our questions .
the memorandu@@ m further calls for a reduction in the number of social welfare , central public services and public jobs , as well as a reduction in public pensions .
why do I hope , and ask , that the framework decision will be adopted and implemented ?
all parties , but Israel and the Qu@@ ar@@ tet in particular , should be public and honest about this .
it has been almost 10 years since the introduction of the euro .
the regulatory framework should therefore be further improved .
I therefore take this opportunity to stress that we need a uniform legal framework .
at a time of crisis , we can take b@@ old measures for the future .

I am sure that smart car manufacturers will achieve the 120 g target , whether in 2012 or a little later , much faster than planned .
this is about the important issue that I dealt with here in Parliament when I was first elected here in 1984 , and when I had the honour of cha@@ iring Parliament 's Committee of In@@ qu@@ iry on the spread of rac@@ ism and fas@@ c@@ ism in Europe .
at the moment when a multin@@ ational company wants to establish itself in Hungary , the course of action is as follows : it receives free land from local authorities , tax and tax incentives , emplo@@ ys people for the minimum wage and does not even allow them to form a trade union .
furthermore , if possible , governments should not improve the business environment , but they should not intervene to change the environment that has encouraged speculation - financial or property speculation .
it 's not a good company to follow .
however , we are working on ca@@ pac@@ ity-@@ building programmes and we are starting direct dialogue with the J@@ ord@@ anian and Sy@@ ri@@ an governments in order to strengthen our capacity for implementation in these countries .
you have invited me here today to talk about our political work , but also about the situation in East Jer@@ usal@@ em .

the adoption of the Protocol on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Moldova in Union programmes is very important for the continuation of more struc@@ tured cooperation , as it should , I hope , be concluded with the Association Agreement in the future .

the return and transfer of Guantánamo prisoners may be a sign of a significant positive change in US policy , namely the move towards fundamental rights , as well as respect for humanitarian and international law .
( de ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have a lot of explanations of vote and we therefore have to stick very closely to the time limits .
we therefore believe that effective coordination is genuinely beneficial for efficiency and also impro@@ ves budgetary management .
surely the honor of these people is most precious after Troy Hel@@ ena , for whom a thousand ships began battle !
I therefore believe that it is important to carry out a thorough analysis of the impact of these measures on the economies and finances of the various countries and to examine the effectiveness of these measures in order to draw the necessary conclusions .
the failure to evaluate the development which is clearly linked to the project , whether geographical or otherwise , will inevi@@ tably undermine the legal situation .
we must shift attention from the focus of the fight against corruption , which is some kind of ab@@ stra@@ ct concept , to the fight against cor@@ rupt people .
( de ) Mr President , of course , everyone knew this and this was discussed .
finally , I must talk about tax@@ -free sh@@ ops .
this is a con@@ sen@@ su@@ al course taken by my group .
a@@ erial s@@ pra@@ ying is common , particularly in the case of forest and v@@ ine@@ yards .
I therefore agree with the question addressed in the European Commission 's report on the need to include gender equality in all policies , as well as in the education of European children from the ou@@ tset .
I have actively promoted this social dialogue with the European Trade Union Confederation , Bus@@ ines@@ s@@ Europe and other relevant partners .
in most areas , the situation has certainly deterior@@ ated , particularly with regard to freedom of expression .
the story is almost ridiculous .
that is why I voted in favour of this report .
it also resto@@ res the objective of the Bali Action Plan that industri@@ alised countries should reduce emissions by 80 % by 20@@ 50 .
however , I do not think that this amount is enough .
can the Commission provide a food aid programme at European level ?
this is not appropriate for the Europe that we drea@@ med of , what we need .
Yes , we condemn the unfair treatment of candidates in the state@@ -@@ controlled Russian media , yes , we condemn the use of unnecessary force against prote@@ sters by the Russian mili@@ tia , but we do exactly the same and in the same spirit when similar events occur in another country or in a Union of states , including our own Union .
finally , I would like to say that the position of the Commission with regard to the numerous amendments introduced to either of the legislative proposals has been submitted in writing to the European Parliament and included in the minutes of the plenary session .
I will therefore continue to work in this direction and , as I was happy to do last time , I would like to call on everyone here , too , to do this together .
if we want to combat discrimination and protect women 's rights , we must ensure that women are not forced to say goodbye to their care@@ ers once and for all , or if this is done , it is an informed choice of lif@@ es@@ ty@@ le .

it was very important that a majority in Parliament voted in favour of our proposal to reject the European Commission 's amendment on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities .
for historical and cultural reasons , it is far more practical and secure than trying to create unity with Europe 's ancient and e@@ ternal enemy Turkey .
thrombin is a natural enzyme .
there has been only one ordinary meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 January , and the conclusion was to call on Y@@ e@@ men to implement a plan for greater political reforms , but the question of Guantánamo was not referred to .
at a time when the European Union supports progress and gender equality as fundamental values , it is somewhat surpris@@ ing that these European funds will be included in the campaign of this nature .
one thought was to bring this article into line with Article 20 of the Services Directive , which would also reduce the risk of legislative contradi@@ ction .
the EU budget should be seen as a capital budget , not as the current budget .
therefore , the method is not the most important one , it does not solve all the problems : without political will and without commitments , the method is useless .
I can assure you , also on the basis of a personal convi@@ ction that the European Union has good mechanisms and appropriate measures .
explanations of vote
I ask you to raise , among the leaders of Parliament , the question of our organisation of work so that we can improve it so that we can vote in time and respect the length limit of our speeches .
thank you .
spending someone else 's money without permission is not budget planning , but the@@ ft .
in order to make rapid changes to the labour markets of EU Member States , it is necessary to ensure that workers have the required skills in the future labour market .
finally , funding from the European budget has been allowed to help countries fighting climate change , an issue which , apart from environmental propa@@ ganda , will certainly not change the future of the ecosy@@ stem .
I ask myself , how has this opening of the scope actually promoted legal certainty and clarity ?
the report deals with many issues relating to the specific instruments that will be used in the future .
as you know , we have already had difficulties in establishing the rules relating to divorce .
I would like to add that the Goo@@ gle Boo@@ ks project will be introduced in Europe , in cooperation with libr@@ aries , and that only covers public books .
the money saved could be allocated to programmes implemented by producers ' organisations .
the European Social Fund could be pri@@ ce@@ less by helping to provide training for the abandoned groups of Lithu@@ anian society .
it seems that there is no central source of information .
the vote will take place on Tuesday , 25 September .
as far as the content of the question is concerned , it is right to protect freedom of information and the diversity of information as the value of all the countries of the European Union , but freedom of the media must not go against the public mor@@ ality and , above all , it must not inf@@ ringe anyone 's privacy .
I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council are of the same opinion on this .
Member States , if they so wish , must also be fully free to enter into c@@ abo@@ tage agreements without restrictions before this deadline .
I would like to emphasise something else : I believe that more than ever we need to discuss what the consequences of a free trade agreement between the two gan@@ gs of international trade on the archite@@ cture of global trade as a whole .
finally , the Commission is prepared to produce an OLAF report on this subject , as proposed by Parliament , but I think that it would be useful to wait until 2010 with a comprehensive review .
the reason for this is the desire to create business relationships with Chinese companies and leading red tape in order to benefit from the ap@@ pal@@ ling exploitation of Chinese workers .
there will undoubtedly be a very deep debate , covering the general concept of industrial policy , the general concept of state aid , as well as other issues .
the le@@ f@@ t-@@ wing people of Europe very quickly notice the surface in the eyes of non-@@ soci@@ alist governments , but in their stu@@ pid@@ ity they do not pay any attention to the wages in the eyes of the soci@@ alist governments .

transparency , open accounts and supervision must make tax ha@@ vens impossible .
we need to adopt a completely different approach to dis@@ man@@ tling and , in my opinion , it should be perfectly possible to convince shi@@ pow@@ ners of the need for this , especially in view of the negative media coverage of this issue in recent years .
at the same time , I still have to express to some extent my as@@ ton@@ is@@ hment at the Commission 's over@@ ly administrative approach to this issue .
the real indicator of the success of the currency is the level of confidence in the market and , in this case , it is measured by the difference in the price of the debt securities of the euro area countries .

we have also addressed the strengthening of supervision of cross-border banking groups .
we are in favour of a peaceful resolution of the situation in Georgia and the conflict between Georgia and Russia .

there has been repeated mis@@ con@@ ception here as if compliance with this legislation could be controlled at international level .
many pre@@ requ@@ isi@@ tes for the transition to democracy , such as an active and well-@@ organised civil society , a free press and a respe@@ c@@ t@@ ful attitude to the figures of the opposition movement and to existing political parties , are increasingly taking hold .
I would like to explain how I voted on the proposal for a Council regulation repealing a series of ob@@ s@@ olete Council legislation in the area of the common agricultural policy .
it is extremely important that violence against women is finally seen as a crime , not only from the perspective of women themselves or of the family as a social entity , but we should also be aware of the associated costs that society as a whole has to bear more and more often .
this is , above all , a human tragedy .
it is very important to create greater transparency with pre-@@ contractual information and information sheets and standar@@ dised information , which has already been mentioned by several previous speakers .
that is why - and I will finish with this very practical point - it is very important that many Members take part in the hearing that the Commission , together with the experts , will hold at the beginning of October , and in the conference that the French Presidency of the European Union will hold in Paris on 23 and 24 October .
countries should be able to change 10 % , it was called interoperability and we have failed to comply with it .
finally , on 20 December 1994 , the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission concluded an interinstitutional agreement allowing the use of the fast-@@ track procedure .
there is no pressure from this point of view .
their univer@@ s@@ ality has not emer@@ ged by chance .
Petitions : see Minutes
therefore , 25 000 people are really nothing : they are a drop in the ocean for the whole of the European Union , but there are a lot of people arri@@ ving in the most southern Member States .
the Union , moving from coordination of the aid packages to coordination of banking systems .
on 12 November , I submitted an annual report to the European Parliament 's Committee on Bud@@ getary Control and on the following day to the E@@ co@@ fin Council .
Nic@@ ara@@ gu@@ a , however , has a demographic future with all its problems , while we in Europe , who are critic@@ ising Nic@@ ara@@ gu@@ a , are facing a tough demographic winter .
after all , that 's what this is all about .
I must point out that those who have always said that we are only doing absolute stu@@ pid@@ ity stick to our position , which can only be charac@@ teri@@ zed in the same way that they use to describe our attitude .
of course it is independent , but we all believe that the end result is positive .
these are the concerns that we should take into account , and that is what we did .
in writing . - ( PT ) Des@@ pite somewhat emotional words on the financial crisis and related crises , there are still no basic measures to deal effectively with these crises .
also in certain governments , where fle@@ xic@@ urity is interpre@@ ted and promoted only as flexibility , the rights of trade unions are further restricted .
Mr Van Rompuy , I think it is time for both vision and action .
if some of the EU institutions wanted to do this , it is right to intervene and set defini@@ te limits that must not be exceeded .
the implementation of these laws will also help to identify the employment of illegal immigrants .
my political conclusion , therefore , is that we need to find a way to strengthen Euro@@ -A@@ tlantic ties in order to ensure greater security and more rights .
this report makes a very valuable contribution to the serious issue of children of European citizens living and working outside the country of origin in the Member States .
I support this decision because further assistance is required in order to ensure the safe disposal of reac@@ tors .
in future discussions and negotiations , my group will stand up for improving and simpli@@ fying the use of the fund .
we can monitor what we do in the committees ; we can improve what we do with regard to regis@@ tries and a number of points that Mr Cap@@ pa@@ to has raised and which are useful to us .
this is our shared Europe .
I therefore voted in favour of Parliament 's resolution because it advo@@ ca@@ tes that :
in September of last year , these limits were reduced significantly once again in order to reduce the potential risks to people further .
this is one of the most important results of the European project and one of the results that have brought the most close to achieving what the European Union will never succeed in achieving with regard to the public .
in writing . - I war@@ mly welcome the proposed Agreement between the EC and T@@ aj@@ ik@@ istan on Co@@ ord@@ ination and Cooperation , which sets out the framework for future cooperation between the EC and T@@ aj@@ ik@@ istan .
these are the agreements that made it possible for the EU Re@@ form Treaty , the Treaty of Lisbon , which is to be signed today , the EU-@@ Africa Summit and the EU-@@ Brazil Summit to be organised .
without repe@@ ating the rul@@ ings of the European Court of Justice , I see that we have reached the point where the Pos@@ ting of Wor@@ kers Directive is being used against national or regional provisions aimed at ensuring ' equal rules of play ' for all workers and ensuring a minimum wage for all workers .
rising fuel prices mean an increase in the price of goods and services .
if we are to take this task seriously , we must make the internal market a domestic market .
we now need to decide whether to allow the urgent procedure to extend Article 186 of the Single CM@@ O Regulation to the dairy sector , namely whether to give the Commission the opportunity to decide on emergency measures in the event of a market crisis , without passing through the ordinary procedure in the European Parliament .
therefore , let us keep the current legislation , because the only reference should be to the country where the wine is produced : Spanish wine , Italian wine , French wine , etc .
your political group , like everyone else here , does not doubt , and everyone here knows which group you represent .
I think that more will be introduced and imposed on London City , with a crowd of tur@@ bul@@ ent the@@ ories against the market .
I hope that this , too , will give the Presidency the hope of finding support for its actions .
it is not right to be protection@@ ist and to close the country against others ; this way of doing so under@@ mines the European Union 's objective .
special Programme " Po@@ wer " ( Se@@ ven@@ th Framework Programme for Research , Techn@@ ological Development and Re@@ presentation 2007-2013 ) ( vote )
the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of this body lies in combin@@ ing political and military , economic , environmental and human rights dimen@@ sions together .
I hu@@ mb@@ ly wish to share the same approach : after all these years , we must still seek a solution for the two peoples and the two countries , which we must not forget , and finally we must seek to support international law .
trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans (
I am thinking here of the rights you mentioned in terms of access to and dele@@ tion and improvement of data , the definition of purpose , proportionality , data cancel@@ lation and the principle of a minimum retention period .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , first of all I would like to thank my colleague , Mrs J@@ ele@@ va , for her lu@@ cra@@ tive cooperation on this report and other Members of Parliament and organisations of people with dis@@ abilities .
no , that 's not good for me !
the fact that some of them are also Europeans may affect the possibility for these countries to join the European Union , but certainly not the objectives of the neighbourhood policy .
my country , Lithuania , is a good example .
thanks to the rapid implementation of the European Community Hu@@ mani@@ tarian Office ( EC@@ H@@ O ) Ex@@ tre@@ mination System and the EU Civil Protection M@@ ec@@ han@@ ism , we were able to provide coordinated and practical assistance shortly after the start of the earthquake .
I would ask the Commission to consider this .
the division of Eastern Europe into parts has led to frag@@ mentation in several places .
in writing . - ( EL ) I abstained from the vote because I believe that relations between the European Union and other countries should be characterised by equality , mutual commercial and economic relations , non-@@ interference in the internal policies and democratic processes of each country and , of course , respect for the will of the people .
we have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament must prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that may occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
with regard to public procurement , whose complex and not always una@@ mb@@ igu@@ ous procedures ham@@ per access to SMEs , the market should be made more open both in the EU and in third countries .
they should also provide financial support for such programmes .
we are considering different options for action , but in order to make a final decision , we certainly need further discussions and consultations .
in writing . - ( FR ) According to the current Directive 2009 / 42 / EC , the collection of data by type of goods for maritime transport statistics is carried out on a voluntary basis .
it is not our job to find a solution to the problem of Alban@@ ian society .
balan@@ cing is a necessary tool precisely during the period when milk quotas are abol@@ ished , as this will allow individual farms to be better placed on the market .
I also stated very clearly that this is a difficult , complex and politically deli@@ cate process , but we are clearly doing everything we can to reach the final solution .
however , we would like to stress that many of the measures approved in the report should be initiated and paid for better by the Member States themselves .
towards a European radio spectrum policy ( vote )
in fact , the priority is clearly known to everyone .
the Cer@@ c@@ as report makes use of this option and proposes to phase out any exceptions relating to the legal maximum duration of working time .
out of respect , Commissioner , and I am talking about the position of the great advocate and suppor@@ ter of the Commission , I have not seen any proof that this is in the legislative programme .
they will only change their judgment when the destruction is already obvious to everyone .
even the British nuclear facility is not aware of the exact quantities of unused radioactive materials in this pon@@ d of B@@ 30 .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
we have also highlighted the need for a long-term plan for the European Parliament 's property policy , which would provide adequate financial support , both now and in the coming years .
in writing . - ( PT ) This is yet another of these regrettable European Parliament documents , which aim to influence the whole way in which the European Union operates , in the negative sense of the word , by taking advantage of the legal status granted to the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon , even though the Treaty itself has not yet entered into force , as we are still waiting for the Czech Republic to rati@@ fy it .
the cultural sector should also be taken into account when desig@@ ning EU policies more generally .
this is a very important point that we should involve here in the process .
I can assure you that my intention is not to destroy something that works and that consumers are used to .
it is important that we meet the targets set for 2020 , that is , to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to increase energy efficiency .
with regard to what you have said about frag@@ mentation and a horizontal approach , I think that the Commission considers that the solution - it is also clear from the White Paper - is a consistent , clear approach ; I think that the roots of European law and our judicial culture are different from those of the often mentioned American .
we were informed about this , but we were not co-@@ legis@@ lators .
the resolution adopted by the main political groups here today is based on respect and consensus , which naturally recognises the situation I have just described and ur@@ ges Mexico to continue along the path towards the rule of law and full democracy .
I agree , I agree .
but it 's not always been followed .
we cannot allow tens of millions of euro@@ s to be wasted further because of the ine@@ ffec@@ tive management of our air@@ space by a whole range of unnecessary air traffic control centres .
these people are not train drivers , but they are still saving lives , because it is their job to do so on the train , and it is very important that there is a certification system for them , even if this is , of course , different from the certification of drivers .
the EU should therefore contribute to the creation of a global food supply system .
I would also like to point out and confirm that the Commission 's Director@@ ate-@@ General for Hu@@ mani@@ tarian A@@ id and Civil Protection ( EC@@ H@@ O ) continues to operate pro@@ actively , and I would like to thank all the workers who have worked with E@@ cho on the question of re@@ integration of the people who , in cooperation with the United Nations , return to South Sudan .
finally , I am talking about consumer protection .
( applause )
of course , it cannot be the same in all countries , because each country is different in terms of democracy and has a different interest in implementing this strategy .
our existing technology , so@@ lar energy , photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic systems and wind energy systems are entirely appropriate for Africa .
we need to get to the root of the problem , not by holding hands , waiting for disaster .
this includes helping people flee@@ ing Libya on the border between Tunisia , Egypt and Alg@@ eria , supporting repa@@ tri@@ ation of third-country nationals to their country of origin , aid and humanitarian protection for those people with refugee status who cannot return to their country - who do not have the country to go - and for Lib@@ y@@ ans flee@@ ing Libya , financing and pre-@@ deploy@@ ment of emergency aid in Libya , and financing of medical supplies , emergency and medical supplies and medical supplies , medical supplies and medical supplies and medical supplies and medical supplies . which will be implemented according to how and when specific regions will become accessible .
I hope that the Commission will find it very clear that we do not expect to pay for the loss of these jobs .
institutional reform is an una@@ vo@@ ida@@ ble part of the solution , but it is not itself a solution .
the agreement will take into account the situation of those Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis .
it did not improve when Sweden started sending refugees and asylum seekers back to Greece , which has been very over@@ burden@@ ed for some time .
( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , pro@@ active action is awa@@ ited from Europe .
finally , I will give a quick picture of the ideas that need to be acted on .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of this report .
I would also like to highlight the prepar@@ atory action on your first EU@@ RES job , which promotes youth mobility in the area of employment in the EU .
if we can prove in Ireland that a particular substance should be de@@ commission@@ ed is necessary in order to combat a serious threat to plant health , and if there is no safer replacement product , this substance can be repeatedly approved for a period of up to five years , regardless of the prohibition .
the true integration of the former Commun@@ ist countries into Europe requires not only truth and resti@@ tu@@ tion , but also condem@@ nation of dictator@@ ship .
however , what we are calling for is sound transparency .
Mrs Ul@@ v@@ s@@ ko@@ g , you mentioned that I spoke more about 20@@ 50 than I did in 2010 .
that is why we asked the EF@@ D to dis@@ bur@@ se quickly .
I believe that the simplification and improvement of the existing legal framework for the labelling of textile products , and in particular the promotion of the development and introduction of new fib@@ res , will have a positive impact .
with self-@@ respect , Parliament will not give up its traditional arch@@ iv@@ ing system .
in addition , energy efficiency will not create high quality jobs unless it is based on a functioning EU strategic industrial initiative without barriers to the free market .
why double standards ?
this report therefore has both a social and an economic dimension .
the communication states that , as a last resor@@ t , a mechanism must be put in place in truly critical situations - and , as I read , this means a new mechanism - which will enable a coordinated and temporary re@@ introduction of border controls .
if vehicles use less fuel , this will create added value not only for the climate , but also for air quality .
the activities of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development must be coordinated with those of the cohesion policy funds in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness .
this opportunity has been given to seven Member States , but only three have made use of it .
if we all vote in favour tomorrow , this could represent a decisive new step towards a tax on financial transactions .
I therefore war@@ mly support the Commission 's initiative and the rapporteur 's recommendation .
Turkey 's neighbours must also move in the same direction .
among the measures suggested , I would highlight the development of equality plans and the fight against domestic violence through the pro@@ cla@@ mation of the European Year de@@ voted to this issue .
in writing . - ( PL ) I welcome the report by Mr F@@ ogli@@ et@@ ta on nutrition , over@@ weight and obe@@ si@@ ty-@@ related health problems .
this will be a lit@@ mus test - including in the Commission 's hear@@ ings .
Mr President , let me start by saying that it is right that the Treaty of Lisbon cannot enter into force until it is approved by all 27 Member States , but that does not mean that Europe cannot move forward , and I , for example , do not want Europe moving forward without Ireland .
provided that the obligation of professional secrecy is applied , I welcome the obligation of officials to issue certificates .
I urge you again to consider your position on Amendment 45 .
I reiterate the importance of supporting these proposals .
I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you a thought .
nowhere is it condem@@ ning the devasta@@ ting consequences of global free trade and market logic .
the social rights provided for in this Agreement are in accordance with Community social law and the relevant standards of the Member States of the European Union .
we have today adopted a resolution on this important issue .
I hope that this assurance does not include any conditions or ways of circum@@ ven@@ ting it .
just a few days ago , we held the first regional conference on the Baltic Sea Sy@@ nergy , which was the first step in working on these issues in the regional dimension .
these studies must set out the subjects of further discussions .
this means that national supervisory authorities must be linked to airports or to " married " airlines .
similar things happen throughout the European Union , and we must put an end to this .
we cannot fail to stress that they are responsible and that they must exercise better market supervision than they are today .
I agree that the proposals should be consistent with each other and with other legislation , but there is no doubt that we had to solve these problems , and once again I congratulate both rapporteurs and the Presidency .
otherwise , the final reduction in quotas without compensation will be a serious blow in 2010 .
firstly , I think that , given the comple@@ x@@ ity and background of the situation , very important and good results were achieved at the Council meeting .
the European Parliament and the Council adopted the current decision less than five years ago .
however , Denmark and the United Kingdom agreed on an exceptional provision allowing them to remain outside the euro area .
honourable Members , when people ask for the floor , I cannot understand whether they want to make a statement or ask questions .
in particular , I would like to address the issues relating to finger@@ prints and , of course , the di@@ lem@@ mas that some of you MEPs , first as EU citizens , pos@@ sess .
whereas it is not right to coordinate pension systems and their reform at EU level ;
with regard to the Council 's communication with the European Parliament , the amendment sought to ensure that Parliament was more involved in the implementation and control of the agreement .
it is quite surpris@@ ing that only 8 % of our companies export goods outside their borders , whether to the European internal market or beyond .
at the same time , they will use the dialogue on social matters to try to at@@ tract workers to accept the reasons for moving forward in a European way .
Commissioner , does your response to Mr Se@@ p@@ pä@@ ne@@ n suggest that you really have data on the high interest of companies wishing to invest in the E@@ IT ?
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for the contribution you have made during this debate .
nevertheless , there are a number of important steps in the right direction in the interinstitutional agreement .
the purpose of this aid shall be to compensa@@ te farmers for any deficiencies due to natural conditions .
if they have already been developed and functioning well - for example , they have the Parliamentary Assembly and so on that we have in cooperation with the Mediterranean countries - they will perhaps achieve a different nature from the other dimen@@ sions , even in terms of funding .
in the debates on Thursday afternoon , for example , we have two speakers instead of five because of the ' cat@@ ch-@@ the-@@ eye ' procedure .
in writing . - ( FR ) The measures taken by the European Parliament following the so-called food ri@@ ots have enab@@ led EUR 1 billion to be allocated to the fight against the food crisis .
there are cases where victims of crime do not have full access to information about procedures and processes in court .
Croatia 's accession to the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Drug Addi@@ ction is therefore in the interests of both parties .
thanks to the work of the Committee on International Trade , some of which are also reflected in certain amendments , of which the Group of the Alliance of Liber@@ als and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 , companies can also request the application of the safeguard clause .
we therefore believe that it is necessary to supplement the proposals now , and we must consider how we can find a practical solution to this issue .
this is very important .
however , after these statements have been made , the report does not highlight all the consequences of the facts presented , but merely makes a few random observations .
I thought I said that the European Food Safety Authority said that the elimination of contamination with anti@@ micro@@ bi@@ al agents can only be allowed if the rules on hygiene are applied , whoever would produce this chicken .
the situation in Libya also confir@@ ms the shor@@ tage of European military capa@@ bilities ; it is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets .
in my opinion , therefore , it is not at all sensible that , during the continuing economic crisis , the European Commission once again proposed an increase in the European budget for 2011 .
of course , the fate of an open world economic system res@@ ts on later .
born and culti@@ vated by the capita@@ list system that creates , pre@@ serves and fee@@ ds these fas@@ c@@ ist groups .
several Members spoke about the Arctic ; we discussed this issue recently in the European Parliament .
I hope that the result will be a Europe of values of citizens , of which we can be proud .
there are already very good laws and safeguards in the United Kingdom to guarantee fundamental rights .
unfortunately , our relevant policy is often still based on the idea that the markets must regulate themselves .
we took part in the dialogue in Washington , during which a consul@@ tant from the White House in the Middle East was asked about the role of the EU .
I think it is a pity that women , no matter how well they are qualified , still have no place in the decision-making and strategic policy of governance .
the proposal that the social impact of all future proposals should be assessed was also raised .
this has been done with in@@ tent , and it has even dee@@ pen@@ ed since it joined the European Union .
we have failed to do this , which is why , at the moment , resolutions are likely to be voted on separately , and all resolutions will be voted down , which does not send out a very good message .
the European Union would like to see a rob@@ ust and effective Arctic Council , which will agree and implement the fundamental decisions on the future of the region .
the European Union , with its large amount of resources , can use all its weight , above all , at the UN , to improve the texts relating to rights which have not yet been properly codi@@ fied and , in particular , to social rights .
secondly , are we examining - Mr S@@ kin@@ ner spoke about this - the best practices in the various Member States ?
( the President cut off the speaker )
the measures do not address the most acute problems encoun@@ tered by small and medium-sized enterprises , namely high production costs and ridiculous producer prices .
however , this is not enough under the current conditions of close international competition .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , as rapporteur responsible for monitoring relations between the European Union and China , I am very pleased that paragraphs 80 and 87 of this report pay close attention to the seriousness of the human rights situation in China .
let us hope that the change in the policy towards the EU in Min@@ sk will be a success .
Mr President , Ireland 's overwhel@@ ming ' yes ' came not only because of better understanding of the Treaty of Lisbon , but also because of the fact that true respect must be mutual and inclusive .
in order to acknowledge and confirm the European message of peace and stability , Sar@@ aj@@ ev@@ o should be called the European Ca@@ pi@@ tal of C@@ ulture in 2014 , a strong symb@@ olic ges@@ ture .
we really must not forget that around 17 % of European families are currently living below the poverty line , and one in five children is poor .
I have tried to do my best for the citizens of my country and for all Europeans , and there have been really special times in this work , such as the Convention period .
I would also like to refer to some of the comments made about imported food .
( FR ) Mr President , this is indeed a historic day for our Parliament .
with this directive , European consumers will have new rights set at European level which go beyond the borders of the Member States .
I have already said this once : Henry K@@ is@@ sin@@ ger was Secretary of State .
in response to the written question , Commissioner D@@ imas announced the drawing up of a ro@@ ad@@ map for the Mediterranean , although I do not believe that sufficient data have been provided on methods of inti@@ mi@@ dation of birds , including car@@ bi@@ de c@@ ann@@ ons .
Commissioner , sometimes it is time to talk , and sometimes it is time to act .
the ratification should not continue .
the focus on these guidelines will ensure that EU legislation is applied uni@@ form@@ ly and correctly throughout the European Union .
we managed to prevent at least 3 000 or 4 000 young people from falling victim to human trafficking during this period in Germany .
this letter arrived after his murder .
that is exactly how credible the Iranian ministers and leaders are .
in my view , the debate has shown us that a very large majority was in favour of the principles set out .
( SV ) Mr President , the question before us is very important and it is easy to accept what has been said here this evening .
this is an un@@ pleasant and embarras@@ sing subject .
the current situation is somewhat un@@ natural and the Commission should create a balanced situation in which European producers are not discrimin@@ ated against , and European consumers should be able to choose whether to buy genetically modified or non-@@ modified crops .
in my opinion , the most important issue that was agreed in the European Council is the sele@@ cti@@ vity of the Stability and Growth Pact .
we want greater transparency , and that is what we will get .
I congratulate the European Court of Justice on its established practice of including in its activity report a chapter which out@@ lines the follow-up during the year in relation to Parliament 's previous discharge decisions and the Court of Auditors ' reports .
at the end of the day , this issue comes down to a confron@@ tation between the power of bureaucracy and the right of the individual .
in point 24@@ 8 , the words ' Ko@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y Nu@@ clear Po@@ wer Plant ' must be inserted after ' Ko@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y blo@@ cs 1 to 4 ' .
this practice continues .
this is unfair to both sides , and that is why we should make this clear .
approval of the ceiling of aid means , in practice , that a limit is set for direct payments depending on the size of the holding .
despite its shortcomings , the project under discussion is worth recommen@@ ding .
Mr President , cohesion policy is one of the EU 's most important and successful policies .
we understand that the administrative burden must be proportionate to the relevant amounts .
I would like to warn you about the non-@@ interven@@ tion@@ ist policy of the Turkish Government .
as a result of the current air@@ space blocks , we have too many flights that last too long and are on too many cur@@ ve routes .
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs S@@ ven@@ sson on the impact of marketing and advertising on equality between men and women , as I agree with the need to develop a code of conduct on advertising that would be applicable in all Member States , which would ensure respect for the principle of equality between men and women and would combat the use of gender stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pes .
I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Constitu@@ tional Affairs , Mr Le@@ ine@@ n , and in particular all the coordin@@ ators and shadow rapporteurs from the four groups mentioned .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned on Thursday , 7 April 2011 .
the proposed strengthening of the various forms of interven@@ tion@@ ist actions of the EU , mainly through the UN military force , without excluding the political or other actions of that country , has absolutely nothing to do with the alleged humanitarian protection of this population , which is hypo@@ cri@@ tically stated in the joint resolution by the Liber@@ als , the Social Democrats and the Greens .
I war@@ mly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and the Portuguese Prime Minister , José S@@ ó@@ cra@@ tes .
as shadow rapporteur , on behalf of the Confeder@@ al Group of the European United Left - Nor@@ dic Green Left , I have tabled an amendment concerning origin marking , compulsory labelling of animal products and eth@@ ical and environmental labelling .
however , I can assure you - I am sorry if this dis@@ appointing you - that the UK will not be forced to join the euro zone .
the EU 's role in energy policy should be limited to :
their har@@ sh punishment gives a strong signal , which should prevent others from commit@@ ting such acts , and a signal that the civi@@ lised democratic world is not quiet and has a powerful instrument against the perpe@@ tra@@ tors of such atro@@ cities .
however , solving this situation as quickly as possible makes us dependent on unstable countries with du@@ bi@@ ous democratic man@@ dates for energy supplies .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this should be a place for free and edu@@ cated debate , but it cannot be that of tole@@ rating my@@ ster@@ y and insu@@ lts , which were perhaps un@@ founded .
thank you , Mr President .
this situation has a negative impact on health , administrative burdens and the overall functioning of the internal market for medicinal products .
I voted in favour of the Commission 's proposal to extend the concept of European cultural heritage as a formal EU measure between governments , which will help strengthen European identity .
we can contribute to the debate with our advice and experts .
in my opinion , the call in paragraph 13 to support the development of democratic parties in Belarus directly in the internal affairs of another country is a call for multi@@ la@@ ter@@ alism .
however , according to O@@ x@@ fa@@ m 's calculations , three quarters of the changes made in poor countries have been made by the power of those countries themselves .
take the UN 's black@@ list , for example .
I 'm talking about the average time , because simple cases are usually solved in about three or four months .
that is why , just before the summer holi@@ days began , our proposals were also confirmed by an approved pan@@ el of experts .
I therefore call on those Member States that have not yet ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Tra@@ ffic@@ king to do so as a matter of urgency .
( CS ) The development of online gambling makes it possible to circum@@ vent the laws of the Member States and to wash the money almost without any control .
we have a saying in German : Ste@@ ter Tro@@ p@@ fe@@ n h@@ ö@@ h@@ lt den Ste@@ in ( the Ala@@ tine drop under@@ mines the stone ) .
we have decided to support the idea of a European Mari@@ time Day .
the EU 2020 strategy remains very far from this .
this as@@ pi@@ ration was a success thanks to the change that took place in the ran@@ ks of Greece , which led to a compromise solution to the name issue that was acceptable to everyone .
I would prefer a scientific approach to an emo@@ tion@@ -based approach to animal welfare .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , Merco@@ sur is a reality that ow@@ es a great deal to the European Union .
in this context , it calls on the Member States to step up their efforts to improve the selection of projects in areas where there are delays and to speed up the implementation of all the projects selected in order to avoid the risk of failure to meet the agreed objectives .
as I said at the time , China needs dialogue with representatives of Tibet in order to find a solution for this autonomy , while protecting the rights of national and religious minorities in the provin@@ ce .
we can therefore clearly see that the situation is also deterior@@ ating in the major emerging countries .
we have received strong assu@@ rances from the United States that they share our determination on this issue .
the point is that national hero@@ es have usually fought against neighbouring countries .
in writing . - ( FR ) On the basis of Mrs G@@ eb@@ har@@ dt 's report , I voted in favour of the legislative resolution which decided , in accordance with the amendments , to approve the proposal for a Council regulation amending the 2003 regulation on jurisdiction and the introduction of rules on law in ma@@ tri@@ mon@@ ial matters .
however , Hungary did not hin@@ der the accession of Romania because it took prece@@ dence over European solidarity and tolerance .
the choice of agricultural products for consumers must also be guaranteed , preventing traditional and organic crops from being contaminated by GMOs .
it would be much more difficult in the future , as it would then require a qualified majority of the representatives of the Member States to block it .
does Turkey and the European Union have nothing more to say to each other ?
the Verts / ALE , GUE / NGL and ALDE G@@ rou@@ ps wanted the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Burma to be included on Wednesday afternoon 's agenda and followed by the submission of motions for resolutions .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I have already presented my opinion on some things during the first stage of the negotiations .
the problem was caused by a computer system .
moreover , a binding mechanism for set@@ tling disputes between countries will only be beneficial to the extent that it gives foreign investors the right to institu@@ te legal proceedings against the governments of the Member States of the European Union and against the Government of India at international level , while local investors will only be able to apply to their national courts .
this can only lead to unequ@@ al access to health care , within which well-@@ identified and adequately informed citizens receive the best services provided in the European Union , while others have to accept services that are already weak@@ ened in many Member States and are certainly not improved by this directive .
we propose that you create four of the Commission 's port@@ foli@@ o c@@ lus@@ ters or groups : external action , of course , then innovation , climate change and sustainability , then all with regard to financial and economic law and , finally , internal affairs .
the Committee on Development 's proposal was to establish national reporting procedures so that trans@@ national corpor@@ ations should report on a coun@@ tr@@ y-@@ by-@@ country basis .
we have suggested a two-@@ step dec@@ ou@@ p@@ ling approach , and I can be prepared , together with the Presidency , to take this one step , but this should be postpon@@ ed until 2012 , which is the last year of application , and therefore the financial year 2013 would have an impact .
first of all , I would like to tell you about the difficult situation in Poland .
it 's complicated , but it 's his purpose .
'@@ Let us examine the Barnier proposals ' - this is empty talk because you have kept these proposals in the file for a very long time .
the Com@@ peti@@ tiveness and Inno@@ vation Framework Programme is also similar .
I , too , am absolutely convinced of this .
it also contains specific provisions concerning economic activities in coastal areas , including construction , tourism , fishing , aquaculture and maritime activities , and instruments for integrated coastal zone management ( such as environmental impact assessment , national coastal strategies and monitoring mechanisms ) .
Europe 's leading role also means that we are imposing an obligation to reduce emissions in our 27 Member States , which we demand from other countries .
( FR ) Madam President , the European Parliament and its rapporteur were forced to reject a bad compromise , which they also had reason to do .
we need people in the External Action Service who think European without losing their contacts with their home countries .
( de ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what we are working on today is to make the law a cross-border one .
Mr President , this is an important moment for assessing the consequences of succes@@ sive reforms of the common agricultural policy , whether from the point of view of agricultural production or supply to consumers , based on the protection of self-@@ su@@ fficiency in foodstuffs in the Member States , ensuring an adequate amount of healthy and safe food from low prices , respecting the environment and biodiversity , and pre@@ serving the coun@@ try@@ side and their populations , who need an adequate income and access to public services , providing them with decent living conditions .
I would remind Members that it was Ireland that put this Treaty to a democratic vote and , in the only phase in which a democratic decision was taken on the Treaty , the people rejected it .
our aim is certainly not to lay down how to hunt ; we do not intend to interfere in the hunting economy .
any aid must be coordinated through ASE@@ AN .
labour inspections deal with un@@ registered labour force , which is a s@@ cour@@ ge for legal employment .
I hope that the de@@ commission@@ ing of the Ara@@ d-@@ S@@ ze@@ ged gas pipeline will boost not only the Nabucco gas pipeline project , but also the AG@@ R@@ I project , which will be used to transport gas to Europe through A@@ zer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , Georgia and Romania .
one of its advantages is a general set of rules for the determination and imposition of airport charges laying down common principles to prevent abuse of a domin@@ ant position .
I agree with the rapporteur on the need to update Council Framework Decision 2004 / 68 in order to increase the level of protection of children and make the fight against sexual exploitation more successful in general .
right next to Europe , there is Russia and Belarus , where at the moment the same high safety standards do not apply as we do in the European Union .
this should be a matter of concern to anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens .
your organisation , this nonsense in Parliament , should be subject to procedures so that we can actually say that we are going to be here and we can be given the floor .
do we have any reason to believe in Russia ?
therefore , there does not seem to be a need today to draw up new legislation on the safety of nan@@ o@@ technology or to propose more amendments .
it needs our help and support .
however , with regard to health , I would like to make a warning .
if the parties there are not allowed to take part in the elections , that is something that can be cri@@ ti@@ cised even before the elections , because in this case the results of the elections will clearly not be able to meet democratic and European standards .
( de ) Mr President , I am pleased that we have reached agreement quickly with all the groups on this important document .
the growing problem is the developing areas of cross-border banking , insurance sales and asset management , which include some very complex instruments .
the Commission 's assessment powers are also well defined and limited , thus making it more , in fact , more difficult for Member States that want to continue their specific policy on foreign direct investment .
while we are talking about the recovery plan , the recovery plan , we are spending billions of euro@@ s poin@@ tle@@ ss@@ ly .
I therefore support the rapporteur 's proposal that Member States should be given access to credit and loan guarantee funds , which would allow those involved in rural areas to make investments at difficult times .
I am absolutely convinced that if such a body had existed from the ou@@ tset , we would have managed to coordinate our actions better , we would have known more and worked more effectively .
no , what did we just do ?
however , I believe that today 's key issue is that we should collect accurate data , because hospi@@ tals and clin@@ ics differ even within one country ; for example , we need to know whether heal@@ th-@@ related infections are more frequent in surgical patients or in the internal disease cl@@ inic , we need to know the strain and resistance of bacteria ; all these data are very important if we want to find the causes and heal@@ th-@@ related infections effectively reduced .
many women work in research and development SMEs , whether directly or indirectly .
( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , the Commission shares Parliament 's concerns .
thank you for your attention .
during the debate and negotiations on this decision , the difficulties which can be overcome have been institutional and geographical rather than party politics .
the Commission agrees with the honourable Member on the report on the specific benefits of the European Social Fund .
at the same time , the Commission must contribute to the industrial re@@ development of these regions by supporting finan@@ cially environ@@ men@@ tal@@ ly-@@ friendly replacement industries , renewable energi@@ es and tourism .
pre-@@ commercial procurement and boo@@ sting innovation for sustainable and high-@@ quality public services in Europe ( short presentation )
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
is there a need for a formal legal framework ?
these low-@@ paid agencies are not generally needed on the labour market and can encourage the perpe@@ tu@@ ation of social ine@@ quality and undermine the re@@ integration of social and professional life .
this should be a new strategy that all of our countries would like to follow in order to rela@@ un@@ ch and re@@ vita@@ lise the EU 's internal market .
let me clarify - the Black Sea region includes EU Member States such as Bulgaria , Greece and Romania , as well as Turkey and the European Neighbourhood Policy partner , Ar@@ men@@ ia , A@@ zer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , Georgia , the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine , and the Russian Federation .
this situation in Dublin is totally at od@@ ds with the European Parliament 's efforts and proposals to make the use of public transport opti@@ mum and , above all , in the urban environment .
however , as far as the issues of inclusion and integration are concerned , my idea is to make them the responsibility of the Commissioner for Social Affairs .
the Hungarian Presidency has set itself the objective of promoting refugee measures .
in view of the above situation , I propose , as has already been said , the establishment of a European Assembly ( Euro@@ east ) involving the Eastern Neighbourhood , with the participation of the European Parliament , based on the principles of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership ( Euro@@ med ) and the European and Latin American Parliamentary Assembly ( EURO@@ L@@ AT ) , the aim of Euro@@ eas@@ t is to implement the EN@@ PI in the countries of Eastern Europe .
the collection and analysis of reliable data are crucial for supporting our work and developing effective policies and strategies .
it should be no surprise to anyone that the debate is moving to more and more modern sectors of the economy .
I would like to stress these advances , as they have been achieved through the active participation of the new Member States and not regardless of them .
let us see how this works in practice .
in writing . - ( FR ) The rapporteur , Mrs Sta@@ u@@ ner , has very well analysed the challenges facing our social protection systems as a result of the ageing of the population and the decline in the active population , which seems to be close to his heart .
in writing . - ( RO ) We welcome Mr E@@ b@@ ner 's report .
this figure has already ri@@ sen to 80 million , in other words to 16 % of the world 's population .
first of all , I would like to pay tribu@@ te to the French Minister , because he was fran@@ k enough to make some extremely important statements in this House .
( CS ) The over@@ la@@ pping and punishment of fore@@ ig@@ ners who commit violations in the European Union may be an un@@ popular proposal , but it is perfectly logical and practical .
it is possible that we have already exceeded the point where we have taken advantage of more than half of the world 's oil reserves .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , I believe that President Barroso is truly playing the most difficult role today .
without financial transparency , we can never be sure who is actually behind the campaigns .
this will be followed by the second part of the sitting - questions about the employment situation in the European Union .
I have a proposal : this resolution is strict and must be strict , but there is no need to kill a sin@@ ner .
to this end , the Green Paper recommen@@ ds the creation of a mark@@ et@@ -based forum for sharing knowledge between sectors and Member States .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , may I respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised .
I am an enthusias@@ tic suppor@@ ter of the Services Directive and I am deeply convinced - and I often emphasise this in meetings with businesses - that it offers a huge opportunity , both for them and for the whole European economy .
Hungary did so before joining the European Union .
bull@@ f@@ ights and cock@@ f@@ ights are disgusting spe@@ cta@@ cles , but the EU recognises their continuation in EU regions with an un@@ interrupted tradition .
when Nor@@ d St@@ ream is finished , the same fate may be caught in my country , Poland .
unfortunately , this important development remained at the Health Council on 8 December .
in writing . - ( PL ) The rapporteur has produced a very good and comprehensive report .
supporting European social models is one of our priorities in an increasingly glob@@ alised world .
the Geor@@ gian Government must also maintain relations with the opposition and civil society .
how can you ensure that the strategy is properly implemented under these conditions ?
of course , it also deals with organised crime .
the labelling of the manufacturer 's name on the food package is also important for boo@@ sting the competitiveness of the European food industry .
as we all know , the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie in Europe or in the euro area .
in other words , how transparent is its funding ?
this is a fundamental , extremely important agreement that deserves the attention and support of Europe .
during my term of office as Commissioner , I have spoken with the Member States very deliber@@ ately about the problems that they are most concerned about , and I have always tried to react as soon as I notice any important problems arise .
these systems need to be introduced .
these experiences allow me to state , with full responsibility , that the dec@@ entr@@ alised model allows for better use of local potential for the implementation of strategic solutions and for desirable changes , and I therefore believe that the objectives must be agreed at European level , but the ways in which they can be achieved must be defined , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , at the most appropriate level , which is the regional and local level for cohesion policy .
at the moment , in the current crisis , everything that sends positive signals to two entities as large as Korea and the European Union must be a good thing that we want to keep trade going and want to keep trade open .
these measures will enable us to achieve much greater road safety and to ensure appropriate health and safety requirements for drivers and fair competition in the road transport sector .
the aim was to lay the foundations for a strategy to promote and guard the rights of min@@ ors in the European Union 's internal and external policies and to support the Member States ' stru@@ gg@@ les in this area .
I agree that we need to improve the coordination of all these issues in the European Parliament .
the use of the Structural Funds is particularly important in the context of regional policy , and I therefore believe that greater flexibility in the Structural Funds would enable us to start the programmes envisaged immediately , as their implementation would contribute to improving the economic and social situation of individual regions .
without immediate , redundant and targeted external assistance , these 10 to 12 million people will have no chance of getting out of poverty and exclusion .
we do not consider in our discussions that the problem is urgent .
( applause )
the EU is sending out a message that political games are decisive in the accession process , not compliance with the criteria .
these events have given hope .
as rapporteur and draf@@ ts@@ man of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and T@@ our@@ ism , we share the same view on free business , and so we have together signed about 10 amendments , which the Council can also give its approval to .
President . - The vote is closed .
in fact , one of the main objectives of European rural policy is to ensure equal living conditions in all regions , so that even in rural areas , men and women can sei@@ ze the opportunity to build something .
we encourage them to buy as many local food as possible .
( applause )
once again , we see that these free trade agreements seek to force through the window what did not come through the door .
this , too , is very important for some in the Chamber .
as Mr De Gu@@ cht and I have already mentioned , we are trying to find a balance .
the decisions taken by Parliament and the Council in 2006 to establish the ' Y@@ outh in Action ' programme and the Li@@ felong L@@ ear@@ ning programme have , in principle , already promised the participation of Switzerland .
it 's the system .
when we talk about training and education , the strategy for sustainable development now requires us to look at them through the pris@@ m of climate change and environmental progress .
the summit will take place this Thursday in Pra@@ gue .
the economic and financial crisis that Europe is experiencing must be seen as an opportunity to adopt measures that not only help Member States recover , but also increase people 's awareness of more sustainable behaviour .
we must do everything in our power to help .
with this in mind , the question ari@@ ses as to how to maintain biodiversity within the framework of intensive economic and infrastructure development .
we prefer general questions about the crisis and its over@@ coming .
Mr President , honourable Members , the new directive shows the Union 's determination to give decisive aid to European businesses , and especially small and medium-sized enterprises , to overcome the economic crisis , which the Commission intends to achieve with a number of measures .
who are we ?
I find this strange .
the other amendments emphasised the need to strengthen the management and monitoring of fisheries resources , as well as the need for responsible consumption , and stated that fish is a natural resource limited in number , which means that there are limits to fishing , export and consumption .
the sales practices in use do not allow an increase in the cost of production , including oil , to be expressed in the price of fish , due , inter alia , to the current import policy .
European research has produced results and these results must now be implemented through both national and regional policies .
as far as the Commission is concerned , support for health care systems remains a priority in our foreign policy and is an important part of our political dialogue with third countries .
Turkey 's accession negotiations started on 3 October 2005 , but the country has achieved only a few progress so far .
the European Union must therefore learn from this crisis and implement the initiatives adopted in all areas and coordinate its joint actions with the Member States .
for the most part , the main points of the report two years ago have been included in the new report and have been further developed .
in the course of this process , we could see how the bot@@ tom@@ -up initiative helped both cases to analyse and shape the instruments .
in fact , the fight against ro@@ gue and exploi@@ ted employers should be fought and , at that time , what we need is an action plan to support employees rather than an action plan against immigrants .
he told me he got stuck in traffic .
the way to pun@@ ish is not always the best .
there are many examples where the Commission , the Member States or the beneficiaries can do so in order to improve the situation in agriculture , for example .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur for his good work .
we should not rush the proposal for the organisation of new elections , because we must ensure an action plan aimed at democratic reforms .
this increases Parliament 's options ; it does not restrict the rights of any Member .
this leaves the European institutions with an important task of in@@ vit@@ ing Russian leaders to take into account the vital non-@@ material aspect of real social modernisation : the preservation of fundamental rights in a free civil society .
nevertheless , there are fears that the work programme presented by the Ele@@ ctor@@ al Commission in July 2007 will not be completed in due time .
this is happening in Slovakia , where , in addition , Mr Slo@@ ta says the problem is that they have failed to get rid of Hung@@ ari@@ ans in their own country and that it is a source of all these problems .
we need to do more to ensure that the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy takes the same pace in all Member States , because if there is a s@@ lower trend in one Member State , it also affects others .
as far as we can tell , the consumption is resto@@ red .
a revised timetable has now been agreed , which is actually more demanding than the original Commission proposal , but , at the same time , leaves sufficient time for appropriate action at every stage .
the role of the members of the Wor@@ ks Council in the process of infor@@ ming and consulting employees should be laid down more clearly .
this resolution also guarantees the protection of refugees and migrants .
we must name things with the right names , because Pu@@ tin 's Russia is where Hitler 's Germany was in the middle of the 19@@ 30@@ s .
in order for these fine words and the main objectives to become a reality and to avoid the collapse of the so-called common de@@ lusions of the Lisbon Strategy this time , it is very important that we give ourselves the resources we need to act .
that 's how things should go , but it won 't .
I agree that the reimbursement of costs will depend on the prior authorisation of well-@@ founded and pre@@ determined cases , i.e. when , within the framework of a cross-border healthcare service , the patient has to remain in hospital for at least one night , where it requires the use of highly specialised and expensive medical devices , or where this involves a special risk for the patient or the population .
we must continue to put pressure on our international partners to implement the existing G20 commitments in a timely and coherent manner and on an equal foo@@ ting .
I , as an agricultural politici@@ an , lear@@ nt from the start of these negotiations when I opened the newspa@@ pers .
we have put the issue on the agenda of the IG@@ F and we will soon propose a renewed plan on protecting children from the dangers of the Internet .
this is not democracy .
however , it appears that , in addition to the stated objectives of principle , such as increasing the speed of Internet access and bringing citizens up with new technologies , there are some very difficult objectives to achieve in the action plan .
I will never forget how your two children , your daughter and your son looked for me a few years ago , when I was in a different role , and how they stood up for their mother .
this requires the financial support we provide .
unfortunately , the conflict in Gaza may have negative consequences in relation to regional support and the issues of the peace process .
what is described as the An@@ na@@ poli@@ s process must not be used as a smo@@ kes@@ c@@ reen , behind which the settlement policy remains , and the Palestinian territories continue to be se@@ gre@@ gated by numerous security zones , which hin@@ der the free movement of people .
this idea is roo@@ ted in the negotiations on the Bali Action Plan .
that makes us look ridiculous .
the report also states that Member States should put an end to cuts in the budget for health services .
this system does not need to be amended in order to enhance the re-@@ use of raw materials .
I think that we would have reached a first-@@ reading agreement even if we had not gone through this process .
the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection commission@@ ed a study which showed that online gambling has the same harmful effects as the usual pla@@ y@@ ground managed by a national lo@@ t@@ tery company .
( et ) Madam President , the decision to mo@@ bilise the Fle@@ xi@@ bility Instru@@ ment shows the success of institutional cooperation and confir@@ ms once again that the European institutions consider funding for the second phase of the European Economic Reco@@ very Plan to be essential .
but it didn 't happen .
there may be a different situation in Sweden , because there are large reserves of hydro@@ power , but there are none in Poland .
before we take action , we must have arguments and conclusions from experts .
all improvements to the Euro-Mediterranean agreements will have a major impact on the economic and political stability of countries , encouraging coun@@ tless social and democratic benefits .
almost every one of us is involved in one way or another in the field of tourism .
I hope , like my colleagues , that in the coming weeks all the Member States will un@@ reser@@ ve@@ dly sign and comply with this agreement because , as you well know , there is talk about whether , with the leadership of the United States or with inspi@@ ration from them , some countries , many of whom are also Member States , intend to circum@@ vent the agreement by tw@@ is@@ ting ( if so ) the definition of c@@ lus@@ ter muni@@ tions and by insis@@ ting on its les@@ ser possibility of accidental damage to those affected by the unex@@ plo@@ ded parts .
I have mentioned the declaration made on 15 June last year , in which the United States and the European Union committed themselves to working to strengthen human rights and to combat terrorism .
this has been made quite clear by previous speakers .
the state is independent when its authorities are exclusive .
this is already the case with the rules applicable to the divorce of sp@@ ou@@ ses from different countries .
the TA@@ C@@ s comply with the catch rules under the scheme , and I am pleased to see that this proposal already helps us manage the stocks properly .
this is the reason why , in June 2008 , the Council decided to repeal the diplomatic measures in 2003 in order to promote political dialogue and to allow the full use of the instruments corresponding to the common position of 1996 .
this issue really falls within the competence of the Member States , even though the Union must obviously avoid any discrimination against citizens belonging to minorities .
we have already seen how the rules relating to liqu@@ ids set a prece@@ dent , making additional security measures in airports the norm Any@@ thing un@@ comfortable , however , these rules on liqu@@ ids for passengers , under no circumstances constitute interference in private life .
we can dance through the area of budgetary control at European level , but , as long as the Member States do not dance , it can never be a performance worthy of a pri@@ ze .
as various people have said , missions are not cheap , so if we are to carry out further missions , we also need an additional budget .
the budgetary procedure is long and difficult , which is contrary to what Mr Le@@ wan@@ dow@@ ski said in the French press in anticipa@@ tion of the position of MEPs .
thank you .
at that time , it was already a long and technically complex document , regulating customs matters in the Community .
I would like to start by saying that I think it is very important that , in the implementation phase of the White Paper , sport should remain at the heart of the European policy on volunte@@ ering , which is in the general interest , without any request for profit .
worse still , the report advo@@ ca@@ tes the abuse of power , using the simplified revision procedure of the Treaty of Lisbon to try and avoid a possible referendum .
if these tra@@ cks do not belong to a variety which has an EU occupation , they shall not be allowed to un@@ load the shipment .
many of our citizens question the added value of the European Union in their every@@ day lives .
however , on the basis of the data for 2005 , it can be seen that the US has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.@@ 4 % , while the EU is approaching the Kyoto target and 2005 issued a total of 7.@@ 9 % less than in the 199@@ 0s .
Mr President , we have clear expectations of the Council and the Commission .
given Europe 's ever@@ -@@ ageing population , this figure could double in the next few decades .
I would also like to take the liber@@ ty of remin@@ ding you that reducing dependence on imports of fos@@ sil fuels remains an important political objective .
- After the vote on paragraph 1 :
this development also exten@@ ds Europol 's area of activity and ad@@ ds to its competence all acts punis@@ ha@@ ble .
however , there is still a li@@ re in the north .
two other institutions joined us : the Commission and the Council .
all this should be clari@@ fied before the legislative process is started .
the Commission and the Council Secretariat shall also participate in the European consu@@ lar cooperation .
the stories we have heard from the people who have recently visited the region are terrible and , as I said , we must do everything we can to try and alle@@ vi@@ ate the human mise@@ ry that we are experiencing at the moment .
as you can imagine , the indication of the country of origin is undoubtedly one of the priorities and main points of our work .
common objectives for reducing inequalities in health and access to medical care are one of the EU 's priorities .
the European Parliament had , in the form of the Ras@@ mus@@ sen report , an instrument for better control of certain parts of the financial sector , he@@ dge funds and private equ@@ ity .
you have now sent the International Monetary Fund there as an attack group on neoliber@@ al capita@@ lism to make the Irish people pay .
we should only resor@@ t to it if there is no other option .
a number of fundamental reforms have been carried out in recent years .
we have been in constant contact with the Tun@@ isi@@ an and Egy@@ pti@@ an people , our delegations , to whom I congratulate on everything they have had to deal with over the last few weeks ; we have also been in direct contact with the government and the services .
therefore , if we do not wish to significantly post@@ p@@ one the arrival of the Members of Parliament , we should , exceptionally , seek the appointment systems for a transitional period , as the European Council has foreseen .
the European Parliament has an important role to play in this collective legis@@ lator .
I would also like to recall Serbia 's fundamental role in defending peace in the Balkans .
we therefore believe that the Commission should forward to the European Parliament the conclusions of the meetings and activities of the Joint Committee , as well as the results of the sectoral fisheries programme referred to in the Protocol and the relevant annual assessments .
do you know any of the European constitu@@ tions that were prece@@ ded by such wi@@ de-@@ ranging consultations ?
perhaps the Commission 's proposal will improve slightly in the course of further negotiations .
therefore , the macro-@@ financial assistance that is now being allocated must provide further evidence of the approach and solidarity of Ukraine towards this country at a time when it is exceptionally weak soci@@ ally , economically and finan@@ cially .
no one is argu@@ ing that coal is an important part of our energy supply , and it is ir@@ refu@@ table that the mining industry must be competitive and that support for it is not the right method .
( CS ) Thank you , Mr President .
I have also been given a clear indication that the United States - including Vice-President B@@ ide@@ n himself - will support our active prepar@@ atory work to send a possible EU election observation mission to Afghanistan , subject to compliance with security requirements .
the legal status of social services of general interest remains controversial .
as before , the main objectives of the CFSP are called for a more in-@@ depth discussion with the Council .
I do not usually take the floor just to express a negative opinion .
, in writing . - ( HU ) As Chairman of the Inter@@ group between the minority groups , I welcome Mrs Lyn@@ ne 's report on the progress that has already been made on non-@@ discrimination and out@@ lines the next actions .
in today 's world , where conflicts also take place in the trade sp@@ ill , the protection of our foreign investment companies must become a priority .
infor@@ ming investment projects in energy infrastructure will help to define the g@@ aps between demand and supply in this sector , and thus also to develop a better common energy policy based on solidarity , bringing the Member States closer together in the energy market .
it is even more important , however , to ensure that the roots of our Western Christian faith do not disappear gradually and ir@@ reversi@@ bly .
the number of long-@@ distance transport increased by 30 % between 1999 and 2000 .
I would like to say once again that I would like to thank all my fellow Members who had been involved in this long-@@ standing and difficult but , I hope , very fru@@ it@@ ful result .
we call for the release of H@@ u J@@ ia in China and Mik@@ ha@@ il K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky in Russia .
the increase in mobility goes hand in hand with strengthening security .
I also call on many Western Europeans , such as the French , to cur@@ b their evil towards the east , as it was the referendum in France that the European crisis ultimately began .
according to the directive , general parameters for energy consumption , carbon dioxide and other pollu@@ tants will be included in public procurement conditions .
furthermore , decisions to grant aid are taken so quickly by the governments of some Member States that they do not even have time to inform the European Commission .
tell me that you will give up your immunity and then insult the Members of this House .
we need a more cohe@@ sive democratic alli@@ ance offered by Lisbon in order to cope with many of the challenges that everyone could en@@ counter in our world : energy security , climate change , the economic and financial crisis and many war@@ s in many regions .
the resolution clearly men@@ tions and expres@@ sly cri@@ tici@@ ses the measures taken by the current government , but for@@ gets that the current mayor of N@@ ap@@ les , I@@ er@@ Commissioners , is part of the cen@@ tre@@ -@@ left and , worse still , for@@ gets the long term of government of Bas@@ sol@@ ino as mayor of N@@ ap@@ les in 199@@ 3-@@ 2000 and as govern@@ or of Cam@@ pan@@ ia in 200@@ 0-@@ 2010 , as well as several years as the special commission@@ er for the waste crisis .
there are some paragraphs in the text adopted that I believe are decisive for un@@ declared work , which is so widespread : we are talking about 20 % of Europe 's gross domestic product .
other messages have also been sent : from small sh@@ ops in the UK , who have made great efforts over the last two years to apply the H@@ AC@@ CP principles and are proud to have succeeded .
secondly , we would keep a total of EUR 300 billion at the expense of the transfers from the European economy and use it here for job creation and other investments .
a revised EU policy would enable Africa to use its natural and human resources in a mu@@ tually beneficial way and to continue to develop its economic and political independence .
the Member States have set up national cen@@ suses for many decades .
Mr President , I have just tried to look at you , but you have not noticed me .
in its history , the development of man@@ kind has been largely in line with the ability of society to recognise the priority of agricultural policy .
however , any discrimination shall not be regarded as discrimination .
in these bo@@ ats , people were from North Africa and sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa .
the chairman of the committee , Mrs Ber@@ ès , has already said that during this period - particularly since 1994 , when the implementation of the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty began until 2002 - Parliament cooper@@ ated actively on the introduction of ban@@ kno@@ tes and co@@ ins , as well as on the preparation of numerous reports , discussions , opinions and proposals , and I would like to thank , in particular , the two cha@@ ir@@ men of the committee , Kar@@ l von Wo@@ ga@@ u and Chris@@ zi@@ ta Rand@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th , who also represented the European Parliament in the world at that time . you gave the necessary parliamentary support to this enterprise , which was originally from governments .
Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Gu@@ al@@ ti@@ eri whether it has occurred to him that inter@@ governmental cooperation would be a better way for the peoples of Europe and for the unemployed than a European super@@ state , which he seems to be advo@@ cating ?
the debate is closed .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fight against dumping is one of the most specific tools for protecting commercial dignity in the European Union in order to compete fairly on the market .
although Switzerland has decided not to join the European Economic Area , it has repeatedly shown an interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the areas of education , training and youth .
in my view , it will be equally impossible to sell products with a message based on gender discrimination or gender stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pes in the future .
after all , IT@@ U@@ C will vote with a qualified majority , which will allow flexibility and change .
he is undoubtedly the President who is looking more at Moscow than at Brussels .
in view of the starting point and the to@@ pics addressed , this was not an ordinary summit ; it was much better than it could have been fea@@ red of some other sum@@ mits .
this is no surprise .
they are restri@@ cting Palestinian walls and roads that break any dream of a sustainable country .
it is totally unacceptable that , for weeks , we are told that we would enter into war with the WTO so that , as Mr De Gu@@ cht told us , we would not be able to sell aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es again so that we would no longer be able to sell anything if we took this decision , while the opposite is expressed in a legal opinion .
secondly , when we realised this , it was the Council that , for a long time , refused to take the necessary measures , which were actually introduced in the Stability and Growth Pact , and to impose the necessary sanctions .
( BG ) Mr President , I would like to join the majority opinion expressed in the Chamber and I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the achievements contained in his report .
someone said before that I had to be an ide@@ alist , a drea@@ mer .
this may , among other things , make mo@@ des of transport safer , more environmentally friendly and more econo@@ mical .
thirdly , although I do not agree with the important parts of the text , I am pleased to continue working on a report that is part of my continued commitment to Afghanistan .
this choice nevertheless includes , to a large extent , the services provided by companies rather than equipment , particularly because there may be very different kinds of options , and because subscri@@ b@@ ers can choose between different plat@@ forms , depending on the content of information and the services provided .
we are not very far from this target , and I believe that all the projects that have been presented can be carried out if we set precise amounts in line with budgetary discipline .
this is a and o of any serious policy in this area .
for de@@ mer@@ sal fish , bi@@ om@@ ass on the Maurita@@ ni@@ an contin@@ en@@ tal shel@@ f has fallen by 75 % since 2007 .
these zones are extremely necessary for Russian and Os@@ se@@ tian smu@@ gg@@ lers to prevent Georgia from gaining any control of the international border with a pu@@ ppe@@ t government between Os@@ se@@ tia and , until now , independent Georgia .
author . - ( FR ) Madam President , Mrs Fis@@ cher Bo@@ el , you said ' no ' to our second question , cla@@ iming that you already carried out the evaluation we require of wine during the reform of the common organisation of the market .
in refor@@ ming the common agricultural policy after 2013 , it is important not to sacrifice the first pillar in order to promote the new objectives of the second pillar .
since subsidiarity is a rule in the area of youth policy , we must encourage Member States to define common objectives and action plans and to cooperate and exchange good practices .
( PL ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Mr Fer@@ nan@@ des for drawing up guidelines for the European Parliament and the other institutions .
however , in Venezuela , as cor@@ rupt and led by Mr Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z , this has not been the case for years .
( El ) Mr President , we do not agree with the political message of this budget , because it has increased military spending and points to a slow , but firm , alig@@ nment of our policy with NATO policy .
the problem is politics .
a possible transitional period should be considered on the basis of its own scheme for each area no longer classified as a less@@ -@@ fav@@ oured area .
however , I must say that the way in which certain people explo@@ it these events is totally unacceptable to me on some sides .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe .
we want to develop and export clean technology in Europe , so that together we can maintain a clean global environment .
how are we going to help Italy , Spain , Greece and Ireland , which is Mr McC@@ ree@@ vy 's own country , if the crisis makes the situation worse there , and , while stuck in the euro area , these countries cannot do anything to help themselves ?
I would like to make it clear that the Commission does not want to close the debate on this .
so if the citizens do not do this , the whole thing will fall apart .
although I agree with the principle of the transa@@ tlantic market , it will be impossible and even less desirable to complete it by 2015 .
who could forget the proposal to amend the Working Time Directive , which sought to reduce the value of work and make it even more pre@@ car@@ ious , to extend the working day and to undermine collective bar@@ gaining and the role of trade unions - contrary to the provisions of the ILO Con@@ ven@@ tions ?
the British energy group BP has already invested USD 500 million in the biofuels sector only in the United States of America in Ber@@ ke@@ ley .
role and place of female immigrants in the EU ( vote )
I believe that the pressure exer@@ ted by the European institutions will help to reduce the repres@@ sion against Belar@@ usi@@ an citizens .
the European Union has been mu@@ te , except for the ti@@ mid statement by the Mag@@ h@@ re@@ b delegation .
following the public consultation on the Single Market Act initiated by the Commission , the EU institutions are asked to reach agreement on the final action plan to be implemented by the end of 2012 .
it is also important to maintain the legal protection of MEPs .
the procedural rights of defen@@ dan@@ ts were not regulated .
we are discussing ownership un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling in the energy sector , its necessity or its necessity .
the pre@@ text was that they were given a written authorisation for Sunday , but Christmas was on Saturday .
there is no reason to change the rules that are generally accepted and therefore only regulated by the Member States .
the Baltic Sea Strategy , which is currently being prepared , is a good example of what we mean by the functional area .
finally , we have accepted the fact that all the meetings relating to the partnership agreement should be postpon@@ ed until Russia withdra@@ ws to its previous positions .
eight bodies have still not been found , fishing vessels and the live@@ li@@ hoo@@ ds of many other people destroyed in accidents .
I am pleased that , following a number of requests from the Council and the European Parliament , the Commission has drawn up an assessment of the situation of the Roma and the related activities .
I am pleased that the Czech Presidency of the Council is taking place , because Ba@@ var@@ ia and the Czech Republic have exactly the same security interests .
what are you going to do about this , Commissioner ?
this is not working , and I very much hope that we will also succeed in elimin@@ ating the last exceptions that allow them to be ine@@ ffec@@ tive at airports , in ports , etc . , and to use un@@ pleasant methods for people .
( it ) Commissioner , before the end of next month , the European Commission will formu@@ late the proposal for a new multiannual financial framework for 20@@ 14-@@ 2020 .
we must now take new measures to combat child ab@@ duc@@ tion and trafficking .
we cannot consider the narrow economic interests to be more significant than the commitments made by the partners of the European Union , especially those who have signed the Cotonou Agreement , on human rights and respect for democratic principles .
it means a more unfair society .
I believe that we can see from our experience that the open economy is growing most rapidly and that increased competition always manifes@@ ts itself as an advantage affor@@ ded by the consumer in terms of the quality and price of goods and services compe@@ ting on the market or coming onto the market .
today , there are far more differences between the countries of the euro area than in the introduction of the euro .
it is unacceptable to introduce a process for authorising the marketing of clon@@ ed animals if European citizens and the European Parliament are not given the opportunity to properly discuss all the effects of this technology .
I am cau@@ tious about the issue of going in or out .
in May , the Council agreed in two other places , in addition to the general approach , with the opposite qualified majority .
the adverse social and economic impact of this derogation is well known and the fear of fish stocks in the region is absolutely justified .
these are the reasons why I voted in favour of this report .
that concludes this item .
I suggest you look at the Rules of Procedure .
to this end , we urgently need support from developing countries and also from countries such as China and India .
it is true that the latter voted in favour of this sha@@ me@@ ful directive at the European Council .
in addition , the French competent authorities informed me that , as from 24 March 2011 , Mrs S@@ oul@@ lie would replace Bri@@ ce Hor@@ te@@ fe@@ ux .
in general , the exchange of information is improved in several aspects : better identification of the cases in which Member States may carry out administrative en@@ qu@@ iri@@ es and the provision of compensatory measures in the event of non-@@ investigation .
however , before drawing up the final wording of the draft directive , I will consult the Members , including you , who are most involved in this matter .
developing countries need us now more than ever .
we have heard that symb@@ ols are important but , at the same time , we are constantly being assured that the European Union does not want to become a state , even though every resolution and every piece of legislation that goes out of the European Parliament leads us towards it .
I think this is the right way to go .
may it take six months , twelve months or two years , but we shall at least begin the debate .
he did not put forward any credible ideas , any positive ideas on how we can deal with this issue in Europe , except for the usual scre@@ ening that he is going to have .
the enforcement of internal market legislation will benefit consumers and industry throughout the EU .
development cooperation forms a very important part of the EU 's external relations .
there can be no tolerance for the idea that the wh@@ ims of some leaders are more weig@@ hed by the will of the majority .
this will allow the use of certain GMOs and the consumption of genetically modified feed products , such as meat from non-@@ EU countries .
as I know how much work was done to prepare this report , let me congratulate and thank the rapporteur and also the other Members involved in this report , as well as the staff of the Committee on Civil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs and our political ad@@ vi@@ sers .
all of these agencies spend about EUR 1 billion a year of taxpayers ' money .
( SK ) The labour market has shi@@ f@@ ted from standard forms of work towards non-@@ standard forms , which is why we must avoid a situation in which employers prefer the che@@ ap@@ est and most useful forms of work , which leads to pre@@ car@@ ious jobs .
many of them live in poor families without access to proper food , health care and education .
the independence of these people and the development of these countries lie in the dis@@ man@@ tling of the foundations of this system and in a policy of cooperation and development aid based on real and solidarity .
I would like to highlight two main ideas from the report .
I would also like to remind my fellow Members that our new power of control over the EU 's executive requires more work than ever .
however , I welcome the serious efforts made by the French Presidency of the European Union , which has tried to eliminate the opposition and to re@@ vi@@ ve the debate on the two proposals currently missing : these are the Sa@@ vary and Fer@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z reports .
this is a financial expression of our solidarity .
Madam President , I do not share the views of my fellow Members who blame the Commission for not managing .
the statement and report by the Heads of Mission out@@ lines the practical ways in which to do this .
( PL ) Mr President , I congratulate Mr Sa@@ var@@ y on dealing with this issue .
however , I am disappointed by the proposals on Articles 65 and 84 .
following the conciliation meeting in November , the European Parliament continues to dep@@ lor@@ e the Council 's refusal to increase the funds for programmes under the heading ' Com@@ peti@@ tiveness for growth and employment ' , which is spe@@ cta@@ cular .
this is a new threat that we never knew before and which we were not used to fighting and dealing with .
the second issue I would like to mention is the role of renewable energy sources and energy savings .
it was easier for the euro area countries to overcome the difficulties , as the European Central Bank provided them with liqu@@ idity appropriations .
it is quite difficult to see poverty in the countries of Africa and Asia from the vie@@ w@@ point of Vil@@ ni@@ us , War@@ saw , Budapest or Bu@@ cha@@ rest , but we must understand that , by helping those who need help today , we are actually helping ourselves .
however , the election observation missions will be financed from a very limited budget of this instrument , which will be extremely important missions which , in about 10 years ' time , have proved their worth and made progress .
the Council was only approved in November .
in the coming weeks and months , we would like to discuss with Parliament how to better implement these proposals in the first few months of next year .
this is why , in addition to other measures , we must support the creation of a European H@@ eri@@ tage Lab@@ elling , which , in my opinion , will definitely increase the sense of belonging and identity of citizens to the common cultural space .
this applies in particular to political prisoners and to Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist mon@@ ks , which have a total of 400 000 people .
this refers to the need for reform and better coordination of economic policies in the euro area .
I am certainly prepared to continue to discuss these issues with you in the coming months and years .
in my opinion , the existence of a public channel which is kept nationally and which focu@@ ses on producing current and up@@ -to-@@ date information for citizens , both in the Member States and throughout Europe , is an absolute fundamental right and vital for freedom of expression .
it is just as important to realise that there have been fail@@ ures when it comes to recognising progress and providing support for it .
our expectations were even exceeded : the Y@@ outh Parliament is made up of 68 female and 64 male members .
at this sitting , we are dealing with individual issues such as Nic@@ ara@@ gu@@ a , Vietnam , La@@ os and human rights violations .
that is why young people , boys and girls are now no longer protected from danger even within their own home .
you have shown today that you keep your word as a politici@@ an .
this does not encourage greater prosperity or increase confidence in these tur@@ bul@@ ent times for the world economy .
Mr Le@@ wan@@ dow@@ ski , you said that the normal procedure is not acceptable .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the spirit of this debate allows me to remind you , Baroness Ashton , that last week there was a meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean in Rome .
it started with great expectations , but so far , the tour@@ na@@ ment is quite dis@@ appointing .
now you are here , and your pleasure is self-@@ evident , but be careful !
the EU , the Council and the Commission must lia@@ ise with the parties involved , namely S@@ AD@@ C , the African Union and South Africa - and I would like once again to welcome the South African delegation here today - and , of course , we must also take into account the resolution on which Parliament will vote tomorrow in the work carried out by the Council .
in Romania , 25 % of women live in poverty ( compared with the average European level of 17 % ) , as well as 33 % of children .
it is a signal that this issue is beginning to be seen in its true dimension , the European dimension .
I think there are some elements that show matu@@ rity and pre@@ pare@@ dness for a certain amount , and one of them I mentioned at the beginning .
the Commissioners cannot give a co-@@ signature to the statements made by the Director@@ s-@@ General .
it is important that Europe , which has nuclear know@@ -@@ how , main@@ tains this knowledge by ensuring , in addition , the training and qualifications of safety inspectors for nuclear installations .
this was a successful first step on the road to Copenhagen .
it prohi@@ bits any restrictions on capital movements , prohi@@ bits any interference with and influence on the activities of the European Central Bank and , in particular , prohi@@ bits State aid for all companies .
the Commission will have the opportunity to analyse and determine whether a company has control over a CR@@ S and whether a company that has rights in a CR@@ S and is involved in its management will have a decisive impact on the system .
rural development and regional policies are certainly an extreme example of the need for very good coordination and the use of sy@@ ner@@ gies between policies .
at this point , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the competences resulting from the application of the United Nations Convention and its Op@@ tional Protocol are shared between the Community and its Member States .
I have always been a suppor@@ ter of the tobacco premium system because I believe that the two things are not related but , at the same time , we should not be hypo@@ critical and do nothing to combat tobacco smoking if we stri@@ ve for another objective , namely the premium system .
young people should be able to make use of the opportunities for knowledge and experience provided by their country 's membership of the European Union .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mr Au@@ dy and all my fellow Members who have taken part in this report .
re@@ defining these objectives requires a serious assessment of how the B@@ olog@@ na Pro@@ cess has been implemented in the Member States .
if we then fail to ensure that the payments made over the course of the year exceed EUR 120 billion , then this must have administrative and political consequences .
it 's a challenge .
maybe they could get 300 votes here , but that 's all .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ange@@ lil@@ li , for the sensitivity in which serious issues such as child porno@@ graphy and online sexual temp@@ tation have been addressed and for the various proposals to keep ' small users ' away from potential risks .
on the day of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , on 1 December 2009 , there was an indicative vote in the Committee on Fisheries on the amendment tabled by P@@ at the C@@ ope G@@ alla@@ g@@ her and others , but the amended draft report was not put to the final vote .
I would like to confirm what Mr D@@ aul has said - that the Commission will take the mandate for a new long-term agreement on 24 February , if you are willing to post@@ p@@ one the vote .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , adopting IF@@ RS 8 will allow our businesses to use the standard this financial year and will put an end to uncertainty .
I agree that the European Parliament must have a decisive role in situations which have a direct impact on public health .
I am pleased to inform you that the European Parliament has an official delegation of the religious leaders of Iraq and Leban@@ on in the Middle East .
the aim is to get the money back to Ireland through growth and employment , not to pun@@ ish the country .
the June List expres@@ ses its support for the civilian population affected by the conflict , but the solution to this conflict is only possible through the UN and with broad international support , not through the EU .
I am pleased that the Commissioner mentioned cooperation with Russia .
apart from this , all the priorities proposed by the Commission are correct : enlargement , relations with Russia on the basis of human rights , and energy security ; stabilisation and association policy in the Balkans and in the case of Kosovo ; the neighbourhood policy in the Barcelona Pro@@ cess and the Union for the Mediterranean , which is presented by the French Presidency of the EU .
honourable Members , as you know , you are working on the legal framework for managing the crisis , namely the banking resolution , which we have had the opportunity to discuss several times .
that is why I voted as I did .
if we do not increase the mor@@ ale of our fellow citizens , we will not be able to restore consumer confidence , without which economic recovery will not be possible , the information that we share with our fellow citizens must be balanced and fair , and not to encourage loss by conce@@ aling the achievements , progress and practical consequences of the recovery plans , while also taking into account the ti@@ metab@@ les needed to achieve these effects .
I speak regularly to volunteers , to the community and to other groups seeking resources from the funds .
we need nothing less than a para@@ dig@@ m shift in our energy policy , but this is not a subject that should be addressed in this resolution .
firstly , during the previous debate , one Member said that the Stability and Growth Pact no longer applies .
I would point out that the preservation of biodiversity is vital to the quality of ecosy@@ stems , has an immediate impact on important functions , such as food production or water availability , and prevents land@@ sli@@ des and floods .
the functioning of the Danube strategy concerns many areas of support , such as social policy , culture and education , environmental protection , infrastructure and lasting economic development .
the level of taxation does not , of course , rise , as taxation in Europe is already high .
I believe that this is reflected in the report drafted by Mrs O@@ omen@@ -@@ Ru@@ ij@@ ten , which is supported by the overwhel@@ ming majority and which is not in favour of the introduction of du@@ al conditions in the negotiation process , but considers that our intentions must be firm and clear and that we must not send out controversial messages , because it can really encourage a vi@@ cious circle in which Europe 's re@@ lu@@ c@@ tance , amb@@ igu@@ ity and contradi@@ ction can encourage reac@@ tion@@ ists or those who oppose Turkey 's accession to Europe , or other groups of this kind that are not in favour of European integration .
I now know that we are getting requests from industry that the EIB simply cannot deliver , because we want the bank to work on solid foundations and not create for me , as others have done .
that is what we must do .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ET ) La@@ dies and gentlemen , the situation of women in Iran is serious .
there is therefore room for interpretation and debate , and I think that the liqu@@ ids ban clearly showed that this is necessary .
Europe is currently going through a difficult period .
we must act in accordance with the principle of prevention and with the precautionary principle , which certainly means developing new tools that can prevent and analyse potential risks as soon as they arise or as soon as there is doubt , and then it would be possible to look at these various problems on the basis of different back@@ grounds , such as climate change or bio@@ security , which are both areas linked to human health .
I would like to ask where this is going to come from , because , if you look at the studies and also at what is happening in Sweden , Norway , Iceland or Bulgaria , you can see very clearly that there is a very high level of participation by women in the labour market and an appropriate length of maternity leave .
I hope he 's put his head@@ phones back on .
these people should be at the heart of any urban policy .
this is , of course , not a solution at the end of the day .
no farmer would use a chemical that is dangerous to public health in common sense .
I believe that the EU must send a clear message of support to the new government in Tel A@@ vi@@ v , while clearly expressing what it expe@@ cts of its Israeli partners to implement measures to facilitate the achievement of lasting peace , including the closure of the set@@ tlements on the West Bank , strong support for a two-@@ state solution and help to avoid the associated military ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations and consequences .
quite honestly , I am ap@@ pal@@ led by the ab@@ uses of some Spanish Members who seek to conce@@ al this activity in this Chamber .
Mr President , my political group supports and wants to acknowledge the efforts of all the political groups in this House to support the amendment to the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow .
we call on the Member States of the European Union and the entire international community to provide Guin@@ ea@@ -@@ Bis@@ sau with the necessary financial and technical support to conduct democratic elections .
we must make further efforts to promote healthy lif@@ es@@ ty@@ les and raise awareness of cardiovascular diseases .
I congratulate the Centre for the performance measurement system , which was implemented in 2009 for the mid-@@ term priorities for the 200@@ 9-@@ 2011 period , and for establishing a framework for performance indicators for monitoring and measuring output , results and effects .
compatibility of the Anti-@@ Coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting Trade Agreement with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union : see Minutes
in writing . - ( EL ) I voted in favour of the draft Council regulation on the extension of the scope of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States .
in this way , and provided that the plan is complied with , fish stocks are not dec@@ lining and these resources can be used sustain@@ ably .
the European Parliament 's support for ban@@ ning and elimin@@ ating c@@ lus@@ ter muni@@ tions is absolutely justified .
so far , the Commission 's approach has been , and you have mentioned it yourself , in general support for infrastructure and the building of democracy through the United Nations and in other ways .
however , we can either hear too little , or the information is not organised , how the legal loo@@ ph@@ oles behind European cooperation in the area of defence policy , in particular , are the loo@@ ph@@ oles .
U@@ z@@ be@@ k@@ istan dis@@ agrees on this matter .
women were not guilty of the financial crisis , but could have helped to prevent it .
some have mentioned the Court of Auditors , but there is no such house in every European country , and they are not all independent .
( NL ) Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his courage in dealing with this issue in this way , because during the hearing he promised to resolve the patent issue during his term of office , for which I thank him .
the main assessments have been carried out in the same way as strategic reports , which provide timely evidence of progress in implementation by the 27 Member States , providing the basis for a high level of debate , mutual evaluation , learning in the past and encouraging improvements in results , even if there are certain restrictions in these reports .
in reply to Mrs E@@ stre@@ la , I can confirm that the problem with my country is that we no longer gover@@ n our own country and that we belong to the EU , and that is what my country 's problem is all about .
( the President cut off the speaker )
the other countries of the European Union should have solidarity with these countries when carrying out work to improve the damage to this extent .
we call it the ' Working Party established under Article 29 ' , because Article 29 of the Directive states that independent data protection authorities in each Member State must meet .
however , this should not prevent us from moving forward .
the second reason is that I believe that Parliament is taking a firm position in support of a strong multilateral diplomatic effort led by the Government of the Kingdom of Spain .
( ro ) I would like to congratulate Mr Stock@@ mann on his efforts to reach a common position with regard to the Council with a view to adopting a directive laying down common principles for the introduction of airport charges at Community airports .
this means a great deal of red tape for only one year .
today , the situation regarding these rights de@@ man@@ ded the adoption of a resolution , even though the amendments to the law adopted this week in the Hungarian Parliament were not taken into account .
until yesterday , the Commission proved its commitment to Dr And@@ reas El@@ dina , an outstanding amb@@ assa@@ dor .
( de ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Wor@@ t@@ man@@ n-@@ K@@ ool is wrong about two things .
Commissioner Ha@@ hn has agreed that the mechanism is complex and difficult to implement .
after the vote , it will be possible to examine how each Member voted .
fishing mortality is too high .
we need a safety net .
I also welcome the fact that the 2020 strategy presents a framework for youth employment at European level .
in writing . - ( IT ) The L@@ amb@@ s@@ dor@@ ff report ( and the related recommendation ) sends a clear political signal for strengthening the status of the European Union at the UN ; if the Commission and the Member States summar@@ ise , the Union gives more than 40 % of the UN budget , but has not yet gained any political influence in return .
but the reason he was missing was because he was arrested .
this is the aspect in which they are most la@@ gging behind , and more attention must be paid to the priority use of European Union funds .
for us , the resolution you adopted on 7 May last year was a very important political gu@@ ideline and a very important indicator of how we should prepare this initiative .
Mr President , thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain your vote .
the scenario envisaged for the Czech Presidency is to prove that small countries are ine@@ ffec@@ tive and that it is time for the Union to take the lead , through the Treaty of Lisbon , forever in the hands of large , capable and experienced countries .
important and significant aspects include ensuring the principles of eth@@ ical evaluation and authorisation , as well as more effective national controls and greater overall transparency .
this is why any measure that assis@@ ts the sector is of par@@ amount importance .
as far as red@@ ress mechanisms are concerned , I agree that alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can provide consumers with cheap , simple and rapid red@@ ress and , at the same time , save the reputation of businesses .
Mr President , I really want to explain how I voted , in particular , on the part of the report drafted by Mr Har@@ b@@ our on the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector .
they say that these proposals on evaluation mechanisms and the Schengen acquis are poin@@ tless because , if the Treaty of Lisbon is fully ratified , they will be amended anyway .
her Majesty has ratified the treaty .
however , we must not forget that Greece imports more than it exports from other European countries , particularly Germany , EUR 15 billion .
the main task is the removal of barriers to trade .
such legislation will ensure that our producers become the world leader in the field of technology , which we urgently need .
for years , we have been treating China as if it were some small child that needs to be s@@ kin@@ ned and debated as if we were some kind of high-@@ ran@@ king institution .
we support , through our development banks ' activities , the development of countries that are showing the European Union a purely commercial antagon@@ ism .
they relate to a non-@@ binding text , which is the subject of the debate in the parliament of an EU Member State .
however , it is up to the Member States to decide on the allocation of public funds to the cultural authorities and the Community 's competence does not allow the Commission to influence these choices .
it would also be na@@ ive to think that the demands for territorial autonomy of minorities amp@@ li@@ fied by this prece@@ dent will not , in the near future , become an in@@ soluble problem even for the Member States of the European Union .
in trying to see this great European institutional platform become a lu@@ x@@ ury of diversity and of independent identi@@ ties such as those that I hope will be lear@@ nt to honour them in the future in the regions of Europe , and therefore , Mr President , I call on more and more people to priori@@ tise their language through its use .
the budgetary margin of the Member States that have effectively managed to con@@ soli@@ date the budget in recent years is sufficient to enable them to respond to the current economic crisis , including its structural aspects , which we are now facing .
I since@@ rely hope that the Member States will take seriously the Pierre de C@@ ou@@ ber@@ tin Action Plan , which is part of the White Paper , and that the Commission will provide the necessary guidelines and , if necessary , economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal .
cohesion policy is a priority for the EU , which is an important part of the budget , representing a third of the EU budget .
global leadership is sta@@ bilising .
the free trade agreement between the European Union and India could be a successful conclusion to the recent dee@@ pen@@ ing of trade relations .
( CS ) Mr President , I too welcome the fact that the European Parliament has set an example with the ban on the import of seal products from the United States and Russia .
China must now intervene to exer@@ t pressure on the jun@@ ta in Burma to ensure that people are represented fairly , and support must be given to Ban@@ gla@@ des@@ h and Thailand so that they can encourage the Bur@@ mese authorities to take a new position .
( PT ) The economic and social situation in the EU requires major changes in the priorities of previous budgets , including the current budget for 2010 , by 2011 .
we were de@@ por@@ ted by a geographical accident created by the ocean and by a historical pen@@ du@@ lu@@ m which , depending on the circumstances , brings us together and divi@@ des us from each other .
even the word ' abortion ' has almost completely been removed from Polish and replaced by the expression ' killing a child who has been conce@@ ived ' .
this is the real situation now .
secondly , the EU should make a special commitment to supporting the parliamentary area .
I think it is very important that we continue as unanimously as possible in this House and that we do not quar@@ rel about the details that we do not have in our power to establish .
a sustainable solution must be found to the waste crisis in the provin@@ ce of Cam@@ pan@@ ia , where there is the most difficult situation in all the proble@@ matic cases of waste management in the regions of Italy .
many regional governments , such as the Wel@@ sh Government , have led the adoption of fundamental measures in the fight against climate change .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by voting , we have given ourselves the means to protect consumers and to give added value to agricultural products , all of which we have been trying to achieve for a long time .
thank you for your attention .
despite any party disputes , it is very un@@ reasonable for Commissioners to get involved in party political matters in their own country or in any country .
the leading authorities would then be able to adapt them to a greater extent according to specific regional features and conditions .
let 's talk about the internal market .
the scope of this decision exceeds our immediate needs , exceeds the problems we are dealing with , which you have decided , with the permission of the Commission and the Council , to turn into rules .
this dialogue was conducted .
in other words , we want to know which part of the ticket price is actually covered by security ; at the moment , only one part of the ticket price is paid for security .
within the competence of the existing treaties , all Member States must agree to legislation in the area of non-@@ discrimination .
however , if we do not adopt the budget in the next few weeks , it will be this last one .
corri@@ gen@@ du@@ m to a text adopted ( Rule 20@@ 4a ) : see Minutes
the EU and Russia are bound by gas and gas pipe@@ lines , but the human rights situation cannot be sof@@ tened by energy resources and commercial interests .
the inspectors mentioned it was somewhere in the place where the system had pointed out .
in writing . - ( EL ) The new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan has been created to implement the EU 's strategic ambition to have an even more active imperi@@ alist role in Afghanistan , Pakistan and the region as a whole .
the Arctic is quite different from Antar@@ c@@ tica for several reasons , and just a few months ago , on 8 October 2008 , I spoke here in the European Parliament on the same subject .
the Sak@@ har@@ ov Pri@@ ze for 2009 ( announcement of the award )

I support this motion for a resolution .

it has proved itself in the area of the energy and climate package and has turned Europe into a pi@@ one@@ er in the fight against global warming .
however , the report recognises the importance of diversi@@ fying energy supply and the use of fos@@ sil fuels , including coal , in the diversi@@ fication of energy sources .

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , allow me to read the relevant proposal : ' dra@@ ws attention to the increased risks involved in the distance transport of live animals and , in view of this , is of the opinion that a thorough check must be carried out more frequently to ensure that only perfectly healthy animals are transported and believes that the question of whether the time of transport of animals for slaughter or for fat@@ tening purposes can be reduced to a maximum of nine hours ' should be considered .
some other issues , such as the proposed law on restri@@ cting containers to road transport , are fresh , and I and all the Commission services will always take up these problems when we talk to Russia .
four years passed and nothing happened .

on the reform of the European Sch@@ ools ( debate )
if we undermine the principles of accession , there will be no more principles left for us .

at the same time , the recommendations and positions presented in this mid-@@ term review are , of course , a priority for planning future research and innovation .
these people must be allowed to land , assess their right to asylum and classi@@ fy them as refugees and those who do not have the right to stay in Europe .

the cor@@ mor@@ ant is protected by the Bir@@ ds Directive and there has been much discussion over recent years about how this conflict , which is having a significant impact on fisheries , can be resolved .

as for the problem itself , my colleague , G@@ ün@@ ter Verhe@@ ugen , organised two meetings where he brought the individual Member States together to deal with the issue , and one result was that the Member States shared information , which was often not done in the previous restructuring .
the Presidency will soon take action to this end .
water is a common asset and it is a great pity that some of my amendments were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
turning now to another issue , Egypt has been a re@@ public since 19@@ 56 , but Mu@@ b@@ ara@@ k is only the third President of that country .
if we want to make progress on this issue , it is extremely important that reliable and comparable data on the B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing indicators be available at both national and European Union level .

I would like to remind Mr Bat@@ ten , if I may , that the problems concerning the United Kingdom and fisheries extend back to the time before the introduction of the common fisheries policy .
ladies and gentlemen , we should be pleased that we are part of this community today and - as is well stated in the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007 - we have improved through accession .
the technical experience of businesses is admi@@ rable , but for too long they have ignored the contribution their products make to the threat posed by climate change .
I assume , Commissioner , that this aspect - an important policy assessment - should have been included in the report .
however , if this introduction would help to realise the fundamental principle of the European Union , such as social inclusion , it is indeed important .
let me stress once again that developments in the competitiveness of countries - including unit labour costs - need to be monitored transparen@@ tly , as it is already difficult to compensa@@ te for the loss of competitiveness afterwards .
Mr President , civil aviation seemed a lu@@ x@@ ury in the past when people , mainly rich and private , used the advantage of rapid flights .

as far as my relations with the European Parliament are concerned , the Treaty is scar@@ ce here , according to which I will simply have to report to you ' after every European Council meeting ' .
there is no doubt that Africa , which is free and which is offered for the first time in a long period of time by several partners , wants to be treated as equal .
I believe that the measure we have voted on today is sui@@ tably balanced between freedom of expression and the protection of the consumer .
growing inflation is another current problem .
all scientific research in the fisheries sector should go through a defini@@ te perspective on environmental protection .
the People 's Party wants to benefit from budget expenditure , so it is prepared to act in the interests of a greater profit factor , in other words to act against poor@@ ly functioning programmes , corruption or expenditure managed through internal policy .
this alle@@ ge@@ dly only re@@ ph@@ ra@@ ses the rules already en@@ shrin@@ ed in the Members ' Statute , but for many people it only seems to be another example that there is one rule for some and the other , and I am glad that the Group of the Alliance of Liber@@ als and Democrats for Europe did not support the amendments tabled by Mr N@@ assa@@ u@@ er .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights may only be binding on European legislation and their implementation , but Articles 2 , 6 and 7 of the Treaties are binding on all Member States .

Mor@@ a@@ ko@@ t was Taiwan 's most victims of the last 50 years of ty@@ pho@@ on , which devasta@@ ted the island at the beginning of August and resulted in around 700 deaths or dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ances , for@@ cing thousands of people to evacu@@ ate and covering hundreds of villa@@ ges with mu@@ d@@ sli@@ des .

several death sen@@ tences are threatened ; there is persecution of intelle@@ ctu@@ als , students and dis@@ sid@@ ents ; people are tor@@ tured ; women and ethnic and religious minorities continue to be discrimin@@ ated against .
once again , on behalf of the Members of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and in the PPE-DE Group , I would like to confirm how important this agreement is to re@@ vi@@ ve the dyna@@ mism of Europe .
to begin with , mechanisms should be created to evaluate the provision of such services and to ensure the quality required .
this report calls on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the Commission to do something that I think is very important , namely to stri@@ ve for common EU positions in the UN Security Council in order to implement their positions through joint votes and to avoid a repe@@ ti@@ tion of previous dis@@ agreements .

I would like to make it clear once again that we are democra@@ ts .
Madam President , I would like to stress that the European Union should not remain silent about the sc@@ and@@ alous violations of women 's rights and personal freedoms in third countries .
( ES ) Madam President , the latest statements by the Vice-President of the Commission go against reality .
in this respect , it is a response to the difficult situation with regard to statistics following the introduction of the euro in some of the Member States of the European Union .
however , the emphasis on the potential benefits of a controlled nuclear response is worthy of support , even though its introduction remains a task for the future .
when I returned from Iraq , I was impres@@ sed by Iraq 's enthusias@@ m for ' more Europe ' .
with all due respect to vulnerable consumers , what we are trying to achieve is a well-@@ functioning market .
the European Commission 's initial proposal did not extend to investments in remote heating networks .
so I am still e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly a@@ waiting new proposals that would make these new measures obli@@ g@@ atory , which would include the total cost of the environmental damage caused and extend the ' pollu@@ ter pays ' principle to all mo@@ des of transport .
you are once again rejec@@ ting your stories about it as if people were more important than business : for you , business is more important than people .
the question is this : are we prepared to spend common European funds on research , technologies , innovation and development in the energy sector ?
you may call this continent with other names , but I call it that .
the third area is a harmonised budget , such as the Cohe@@ sion Fund and the trans-European transport networks .
if you do not speak with one voice , you do not need a mes@@ sen@@ ger .
the comments from these countries - including those who initially were very scep@@ tical about the measure - are ultimately positive .
inspectors should receive all the information they need but be atten@@ tive in those areas where the information should not be made public .
therefore , by celebra@@ ting this day and calling on all women not to give up their dreams , we reiterate once again that the fight against in@@ justice and discrimination is important , because it opens up new prospects for a better and more equal life .
in fact , all countries are benef@@ iting from globalisation , both developing countries , new industri@@ alised countries and even developing countries , whose taxpayers cannot afford an exces@@ sively squ@@ and@@ ering government apparatus more finan@@ cially .
the European Union is concerned that the outbreak of violence in La@@ â@@ youn@@ e may hin@@ der the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to find a solution acceptable to both parties to the conflict in Western Sahar@@ a .
we must also point out that this proposal does not concern the protection of tra@@ de@@ marks or protective labels and does not help protect these signs and marks .
we must protect our fellow citizens and our businesses .
this ultimately jeopar@@ di@@ ses the standard of living of ordinary people .
finally , I would like to stress that elderly women are still victims of a number of forms of discrimination , both gender and age .
thank you for your cooperation , thank you to all the women for their e@@ ag@@ er@@ ness , and thank you in particular to the few men who endu@@ red all these women .

I have a sample for every year , but I doubt the general can try them all .
a blow .
he ris@@ ked his life and B@@ rec@@ ca 's life to satisfy his ambition and pride .
Lana , I really didn 't expect all of this .
my mom doesn 't even talk to me .
these sh@@ ri@@ mp are good and fresh .
it happened on August 12 in She@@ ep 's Me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws .
there 's nothing out there but shame and hate .
- Are you interested ?
Hey !
don 't worry .
" send Dr. Z@@ ola over to Switzerland ? "
don 't worry .
only then , no one can hurt you .
- Nice hand@@ writing .
are you a cop ?
Captain Tan@@ ner , you fle@@ w on six sh@@ ut@@ tle missions .
I 'm fine .
we 're exp@@ anding the search area .
like here ?
we didn 't know about your meeting .
I don 't know , C@@ lin@@ ton .
they 're on their way .
fro@@ g 's breath da@@ mp@@ ens every smell .
things didn 't go exactly as planned .
you have to go to church with the cand@@ les of the Vir@@ gin Mary .
it 's right here in Washington H@@ os@@ pi@@ tal .
Ed@@ mun@@ ds !
Yeah .
no .
you know how much they 'd pay for this ?
good job , White .
nothing ?
he 's been dating the hospital for ten months .
good job .
you were dead .
a special place to call yours .
- It 's all right .
he saved me from poverty .
- The place was free .
I 'm not telling you to stop doing this .
why are you running ?
I need to call Sti@@ tch .
I 'm not gonna let you in a teacher 's room or school .
my mother liked to share with me the son@@ gs she liked in her youth .
- He was min ...
M@@ ika 's dead .
I 'm totally ....
- We 'll find out .
anyway , it 's an animal pa@@ trol area .
but that 's what we 've been trying for over an hour .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter .
he said he took a train to Por@@ t@@ land work every day , but his car always left the station .
that 's Katie ?
calm down !
let 's go .
Yes !
- He can handle himself .
but the rest of you , that 's the end of my story .
what do you think of that ?
L@@ el@@ and ?
is it , and we 'll all see .
the air above us is made up of several la@@ yers , and now I have a chance to see what they 're doing .
- Yes , I do .
- No , it 's an eleva@@ tor .
Nicho@@ las ?
that fucking sh@@ i@@ ane needed a first move , but I couldn 't get it in .
listen , you know what , there 's a cold beer in the fri@@ dge and there 's clean sheets in bed .
but that speech was the complete opposite of F@@ resh Prince 's speech .
we 've been trying to reach your parents .
I know , I ...
not Jen .
from an old far@@ t like that who has a bro@@ om@@ stick up his ass ?
what 's weird is that you 're a pri@@ est and you sleep on the cou@@ ch instead of sleeping as a man in bed next to him .
Commander .
he felt really bad when he was expe@@ lled , but he de@@ served it .
what happened to us ?
I could be John Wa@@ ke@@ field 's daughter .
we got a saying at Bay City :
Ma@@ ren 's a hot woman .
- O@@ pen@@ ed at the moment of birth .
I knew you 'd come back .
it 'll take you straight to the street .
all right .
is it possible it could lead to another pot ?
what 's your big plan , Elena ?
- Good .
- That 's all right .
it was from Her@@ b 's office .
Leslie , that comment wasn 't really about whether you were good at bow@@ ling ,
we got a call from the Bo@@ ston Police Department .
he would have done the same thing .
Oh , my God .
I 'm sorry , Your High@@ ness .
remember my face ... and you will get your revenge in your next life !
if we 're so disgusting to you , we 'll break it .
no , Nina !
- We 're don@@ ating money right now .
no , no , no , no more bad news from you !
- Ma 'am , are you ready ?
thanks for telling me , Brian .
O@@ ce@@ ano Res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant .
straight to In@@ sta@@ gram !
general Ham@@ mond , I 'd rather die than give out any information on this world .
H@@ ic@@ cup , quick .
you had no right to spy in my lab .
no movie , either .
I can 't find my money .
Vi@@ ole@@ t !
Phili@@ ppe !
I 'm not stupid .
- Why not ?
you 're angry about what I said about Mar@@ y@@ an@@ n .
- Bo@@ y !
I 'm sorry .
the car@@ bin@@ s are for protection .
I can 't confirm that .
make up with Lisa .
after the or@@ p@@ han@@ age , I was alone , and Caesar was one of the boys I ran around with .
how 's your sister ?
military technology .
you 're back .
this has been a problem a long time ago .
Car@@ a , John , where are you ?
I thought you were dying .
do you like it ?
nice to meet you .
it 's pretty simple .
if there 's any chance this guy is Tul@@ ly 's secret weapon , we 're gonna need a lot more than his high school grade !
no , not you .
you deserve to know that .
one I 'll attend this night .
my mother lied to everyone .
I 'll call you later !
no , Fer@@ dl takes care of the technical side .
we would very much like to hear more about your order .
tell me what 's wrong .
he 's back here .
I 'll also give you a bag of meth@@ amp@@ he@@ tamine .
I know it 's temp@@ ting , but ...
I 'm a regular Chinese man ...
I 'll see you in a little while .
you shoot me , my leg comes from a clu@@ tch .
what are you doing ?
no , no one but me can finish this .
I told you you could have a stroke .
it 's considered a public challenge to me !
it 's okay .
and once they are wor@@ n ... people will be able to understand the size of our time ... because of what you , my Lea@@ der , mean to Germany !
sometimes I remember being just a machine .
okay , I got it .
Daddy .
Johnny , I 've given you some breathing space because when I watch you dance , I 'm gonna get fi@@ er@@ cel@@ y hard , just like a lot of other people .
now the ca@@ val@@ ry is rus@@ hing over our children .
it 's distur@@ bing .
I 'm very sorry , sir .
remember ?
- Come on .
- And that 'll be three pounds .
he mis@@ ses you .
I 'm trying .
- I can tell Pete the truth .
Vik@@ tor !
Hey , B@@ o .
relationships are work .
♪ Or another un@@ fulfilled dream ?
I want to meet you .
who are you ?
I promised you I wouldn 't do anything without your permission .
run !
why don 't you try a fa@@ ire@@ r rhyth@@ m ?
- Do we have a mother ?
it 's just a thought of something bad that could happen .
no !
it 's cellu@@ lo@@ id propa@@ ganda .
I mean , I don 't think so .
" God 's breath On@@ ly a man who reg@@ re@@ ts sin shall pass . "
so what are you shit@@ ting for , man ?
my days are numb@@ ered in the FBI .
ri@@ b in sharp sau@@ ce .
I 'll wait .
let 's just say that .
but you didn 't call me back .
I 've been following a blind man .
45 minutes of C@@ SI@@ s , and I already know what 's going on .
I don 't know how to say it , but you touched something about me .
N@@ os@@ tra@@ da@@ mus is trying to scare us to stop the ocean from rising , to stop its children from star@@ ving , to stop the climate from getting out of control .
- Shut up .
- Oh , he 's real .
you can come every day , but do we have to keep fighting about the suit@@ case ?
I don 't know you .
no .
he put everything on paper .
again .
how can you win if I don 't fight ?
I have no idea .
- I found them all but Mr. Hen@@ der@@ son .
- September 15 .
where are you going ?
but he can be stopped .
Law@@ ton , he 's not answ@@ ering .
that 's how we get more people .
I didn 't want our last conversation to be remembered for the last conversation .
you 're not .
isn 't that what you wanted , Win@@ ter ?
someone 's paying attention .
what 's wrong with everyone ?
Lau@@ rie , pick up the fucking phone .
in the clo@@ set .
- So they know something about explo@@ si@@ ves ?
you see what I have to endu@@ re !
Hey !
I think one of the blue wi@@ res has been dis@@ connected .
I think Bee@@ tho@@ ven has a girlfriend .
P@@ us@@ h@@ kin .
re@@ treat !
the lights ...
I think that 's why I 'm going on this trip .
are you all right , sweetheart ?
there 's a list .
not us , Li@@ z .
the sickness will convince you that you don 't have it .
however , I am convinced that child ab@@ duc@@ tions have a great future .
there 's a new one up there , man .
outside the party ?
Lo@@ ren@@ zo , close your eyes .
there he is .
- Excuse me .
can you say " Ale@@ ck@@ o " ?
is that public administration ?
- I 'll see what I can find .
Yes , sir .
nine more months to go ...
no grapes .
I 'd choose words if I were you , tra@@ itor .
- Cal@@ m down !
senti@@ mental .
we 're down here .
I 've decided to share your food and drink .
I 'm not fighting you , the only thing to do is shoot !
nice !
you already have .
I don 't think it 's lunch .
exactly .
they 'd start flying in first class , staying at an exclusive 5 star hotel where they 'd spend their days at the pool and making love to the night .
when we 're done here , let 's see if we can find clean clothes .
I 'm not un@@ happy .
I like your hair , like Sta@@ mos .
Walt 's with your husband ...
then we kill him .
it 's like they have the right to condemn us .
apparently , a small world .
you 're just gonna make a little opening so the air can get out .
a mag@@ nific@@ ent combination of fear and squ@@ and@@ ering , pas@@ sion and shape .
because what follows is hopefully beyond your imag@@ ination .
nothing .
we don 't discuss our own business with adults .
on his way ?
and then fli@@ r@@ ting with the opposite sex of work ... then , unfortunately , you get pregnant , a fast wedding , and you live in luck .
only the facts , no other things .
heads up , gentlemen .
just once .
thank you , thank you very much .
Yeah , we really are .
I think I know why D@@ om 's here .
- no ice in the co@@ g@@ na@@ c .
- No !
you want protection ?
where 's my cell phone ?
in case you change your mind .
- For old times ' sake ?
he turned your finger around , Ted .
I told you we all wanted to get a whi@@ p , but we don 't have time for this .
you thought you had it all figured out , F@@ ish ?
no doubt .
I own the Si@@ x@@ th R@@ ain@@ bow City .
where is he ?
he 's a distra@@ ction .
excuse me , Mr. Re@@ thri@@ ck .
why ?
Oh , my goodness .
I 'll check .
you can 't tell an old man .
what I 'm asking is simple .
he wants to take control of his collective .
I 'm not ready to build a home .
that 's ridiculous .
this could be a waste of time for someone else .
Yeah .
what have I done ?
I 'm not like the others , I 'm not involved in your war .
I heard .
local police arrested the owner of the club .
- That would mean a lot of problems at the same time .
you said you believed in me , but you lied !
did you work at Gri@@ mal@@ di 's wedding ?
smile !
- M@@ ass murder ?
I 'm sorry , I know he was your friend .
because you 're not putting pressure on her from the right place .
are you kidding me ?
they 're all dead .
Hey , you got a cor@@ n@@ fla@@ ke ...
cool !
I knew you 'd sell your mother for the wh@@ ale of E@@ trus@@ ki , and I didn 't know you 'd sell your land and soul to man@@ kind .
you 're too young for this !
that you scan@@ ned my eggs for kidna@@ pping D@@ R@@ N from the hospital and causing damage in millions of dollars .
April 19@@ th , 3 : 00 to be exact .
can you reach the window of the roof ?
its bla@@ de is val@@ y@@ ri@@ an steel , pi@@ pe dra@@ gon .
because you 're the same .
you talked to Blan@@ che ?
don 't let your nose down , Car@@ son .
you 're tor@@ turing yours ?
no , it 's not .
- He was an ac@@ compli@@ ce .
I 'm glad you 're feeling better .
you two aren 't ...
drinks for all 100 .
do you see a tre@@ mbling tat@@ too@@ ed thing that bu@@ ys gras@@ s at 3 : 00 in the morning ?
a normal life doesn 't suit me , but when I drink wine in the ocean or spend time with a beautiful stran@@ ger , I feel like myself .
some time earlier this year , maybe towards the end of January , this cli@@ mb ( master sa@@ mu@@ ra@@ i ) named Mot@@ ome Chi@@ j@@ i@@ i@@ wa came to visit , and his visit was the same as yours .
easy , you just have to ...
I recognized you from the file .
and you know what else ?
this war is all nothing .
but you need to calm down , okay ?
are you kidding me ?
what do we do ?
I made J@@ ell@@ -@@ O myself , and ...
everyone inside was killed .
dear Bro@@ ok@@ lyn Bo@@ y ,
ready .
no one lives there , and no one goes there , and fishing in there is awful good .
I 'll take care of them .
we have organs , but there 's no money .
I did everything you told me to do .
all right .
even if you don 't want to .
Yeah .
Al@@ p@@ ha , Z@@ ul@@ u , 4-@@ 2-@@ 5
by the way , Claire works for me .
looks empty today .
if I ask my father who could become of me , he has no idea .
did he say tas@@ ty con@@ doms ?
- That 's all right .
what is ... a kiss ?
they 're assh@@ oles .
press the number one and then the green one .
come on .
one dinner .
the war@@ den said the price has ri@@ sen .
- Exc@@ ell@@ ent .
- Good to see you again .
I don 't want to decide to the detri@@ ment of your client , but I don 't see how , given the facts , I could do differently .
your parents , the de@@ an , or your wife ?
where are we going ?
- You wanna see what I can do
Li@@ u J@@ in@@ x , what kind of man are you ?
your character , your clothes and your address .
but maybe they 're in the garden .
he 's been hiding somewhere .
it 's in Mar@@ in .
no .
the beautiful Co@@ om@@ b coun@@ ty is at 8 : 00 , and once again , the cops have refused to comment on this stri@@ ped light game seen in the local sky .
it 's too dangerous .
you can 't pass it .
admi@@ rable .
do you know anything about this ?
what was that ?
welcome to the club .
so whatever you want , do it yourself .
did he know who my mother had given birth to me ?
nice guy .
all right .
shame on you for rus@@ hing it .
if you didn 't say anything , it might have just gone by .
I just gave it back to him .
what if we all voted for him , funny , and he won ?
he 's fine .
let the drinks stay .
I 'm Jim Lo@@ v@@ ell , and this transmission is coming to you , 320 000 kil@@ ome@@ ters high , and we promise you a good show .
cities were burned , youth re@@ bel@@ led , the President 's ob@@ s@@ olete , the leaders were killed .
have a good day ,
that means Sid@@ ney Bern@@ stein .
it 's not because of Jen@@ na , it 's because ...
Yep .
you 've been very friendly and very kind .
I 'm gonna die .
no more talking about hur@@ ting the baby .
- He can turn us all in .
( g@@ run@@ ts ) ( gas@@ ps )
I sent M@@ asu@@ ka to T@@ il@@ den 's house to search for evidence of the murder that took place there .
I 'm getting used to it .
it 's a safe location .
when the cur@@ tain rises , I rise .
- Per@@ fec@@ t big place ?
these people .
I keep it for a special occasion .
get in the car , Hoo@@ ch .
Yes , it is .
that 's your assig@@ nment .
Caroline went to school early .
that 's not the point .
you 'll take it as a symbol of your intention to stay so@@ ber .
no , it 's okay , it 's tradition .
this is Me@@ gre@@ z .
that 's my opinion .
really ?
pal@@ ms up , like you 're holding a pizza .
when I was at Tom and My@@ r@@ tle 's secret apartment , ma@@ dness gra@@ bbed us .
look , you got the fish !
I can 't keep it open forever , J@@ uni .
an address ?
damn .
two sna@@ kes with emer@@ ald eyes .
- Shut up !
he cut his head off .
so I think I 'm doing him a favor .
so when the cool is done with Angel@@ o , we can be too ?
maybe your girlfriend knows .
Er@@ nie .
I 'm a bu@@ tler at Dar@@ ling@@ ton Man@@ or , and my employer is Mr. Lewis , an American gentleman .
are you capable of doing this ?
I know about death , Winston .
- That 's your reaction ?
come on .
I ple@@ dged it to F@@ ell@@ man .
your father will be aven@@ ged .
did you like that car ?
you have to open it .
no problem with that , talk to me !
you , too .
keep pulling .
well , I don 't think you 're strong enough to tell me what to do in my own hotel room .
what are you saying ?
was it fun ?
it 'll be forever .
when did this Mac@@ Arthur get used to you ?
now you 're here to tell me how everything is fine .
why is he here ?
come on , come on .
it 's Friday night .
- Hon@@ ey .
please , War@@ ren .
- ... then carry on ...
he 's gone now .
isn 't that right , honey ?
you 're young for such a position .
S@@ te !
Hey , baby .
don 't let me down .
I think I 've coun@@ ted the civilian ships before I left .
that 's why ?
don 't tell me .
I don 't like him .
can 't you see Dad wants to sleep ?
why is S@@ cor@@ pi@@ us still in Ch@@ ri@@ ch@@ ton 's mind ?
intelligence says they 'll be flying close to us , and then we 'll hit them .
welcome , Billy .
where 's your li@@ eu@@ tenant ?
in the meantime , hide them in your ba@@ sement .
what , ro@@ bbing a bank ?
she said Tyler had nothing to do with your guns .
very clas@@ sy .
- Sergeant Land@@ ers !
what do you mean ?
- I 'm about to get to it ...
look .
go ahead , Ka@@ hn .
- The bra@@ ces .
next week ?
- No ?
this is our best office .
shit !
wait , wait , this is how it works .
- Kar@@ ina didn 't tell me anything about it .
I don 't know what you were taught in medical school , but you should be absolutely sure what you 're doing .
looks like Daniel might have developed his own M@@ CP .
shoulder bag .
it 's a Char@@ n@@ wood forest near Le@@ ic@@ ester@@ shire in the middle of England .
like a tra@@ mp@@ oline , for example !
Yeah .
don 't worry !
I think I know how to set aside enough money from school to buy us a vil@@ la in Wa@@ ik@@ ki .
he was standing two feet away from you with a loaded fire@@ arm .
believe it or not , Dr. Woo@@ ds , there are many people in this world who believe there is something that cannot be explained by science .
B@@ j@@ or@@ n is very happy here .
a rapid change doesn 't mean I can travel through time .
maybe I should send a sister to a bo@@ xing match if I have a play with Ty@@ son .
what 's that ?
good Mike .
what makes you think it was a trick ?
I was .
Bru@@ tal , no .
thank you .
I 'm trying to break the pattern .
two !
" in the video of his e@@ ternal youth ... " I remember that sentence .
at least some of them understand how important it is to stay on this ship ...
- So are the others .
- Just stop .
I know she thinks she can do this alone , but she did everything to her .
then I hit the statu@@ e instead .
get back .
your harmon@@ y , Ma@@ dame S@@ hir@@ mer .
Matt , stop talking .
y@@ elling what ?
- Wait a minute .
because of your advice , my professional advice .
okay .
but their interest is great .
I 'm going to be a little personal with you here .
smile less , it helps .
I don 't think so , Mor@@ an .
Yeah , you probably know .
brilliant !
there 's still the question of who killed Le@@ ila , our acqu@@ ain@@ tance .
with the boys ?
look at this .
Ca@@ mbri@@ dge finished and so on .
I lost the R@@ 2 in battle .
then , for God 's sake , find him !
are you ready ?
how 's that good ?
hundreds of tom@@ bs have grown during the D '@@ Har@@ ans war .
the weight was almost 19@@ -@@ p@@ ound .
on the screen ... there are an@@ omali@@ es .
who 's a good girl ?
try and do the best .
it 's a gift from my little sister and a nice cop from Carter .
- Hi .
or I 'll compla@@ in to the police .
can I talk to you ?
Eddie , you 're up .
don 't even ask why .
I like what you 've done here .
mother nature has been in a bad mood lately .
all I can give you is love ... that will last forever ...
I didn 't know it was that loud .
- No .
they need me in the delivery room .
I 've got them all with my best friend , L@@ ight@@ ning Mc@@ Queen .
you ruined his party .
great letter of recommendation .
- Three .
- That you 're not going there because there 's no whis@@ key offered .
I like you , Ver@@ on@@ ica .
nervous ?
and do these other worl@@ ds have crea@@ tures that break heads like us ?
find a rhyth@@ m .
no one 's gonna hurt you , ' cause I won 't let you .
what I 'm trying to say is that this company needs protection .
I have excellent news about my new program .
stay there , Charles .
- Who are you ?
maybe the Isra@@ e@@ lis have information .
come on .
we should move to Hong Kong .
why ha@@ y ?
go , Bur@@ t !
he 's so s@@ kin@@ ny !
no , he left around 10 : 00 .
I always liked you , Lu@@ ther .
it is now just a matter of time before the President is asked .
therefore , the WHO epidemi@@ olog@@ ist will be sent to Hong Kong .
but you need a little bit of bic@@ y@@ cle .
did they have sex here ?
- No !
Oh , my God !
- Okay .
I know , I am .
and a bomb .
Z@@ en@@ ya 's right .
are you all right ?
but what would Jesus say to the atten@@ dan@@ ts who find it hard to believe in him ?
just relax , Pas@@ cal .
in the meantime , good things happen unexpe@@ c@@ tedly , like pe@@ anu@@ t butter and chocolate mer@@ ged , or M@@ oun@@ t Rus@@ h@@ more .
miss R@@ ain@@ es , I strongly recommend working with the defense at@@ torney to find a fa@@ ire@@ r solution .
you down@@ loaded the Inter@@ se@@ ct 2.0 .
- I see things as a huge sal@@ mon !
- the loo@@ p clo@@ ses at 16 : 30 .
don 't res@@ ist .
every time I think about it , I make sure I did the right thing .
it 's working im@@ pul@@ sively .
- It 's a P@@ ila@@ pen .
they 're very fragile .
we got it .
everything is calm in the for@@ tress .
what time did it start ?
that would be a massive mas@@ sac@@ re .
- What 's the reality ?
- And you want ...
more !
- You 're lying .
four months just stealing .
easy now .
very nic@@ ely done .
one is harm@@ less .
so you 're coming ?
you 've already told me everything .
- Bruce Wayne ?
more than a man painting the future ?
- I should get going .
Molly !
- But it 's not .
that baby with a lol@@ lipo@@ p .
I said wipe your shoes before you get in the car .
I didn 't know you were coming .
good morning .
have a seat .
otherwise , his parents will not be the police .
you say the price , I take 25 % .
I 'll be waiting for you in the car .
I can 't .
right .
truth serum is fun .
it 's like he 's making fun of us .
that 's right .
Gus , what do you call people in movies ?
we 'll just have to wait to get him to a crow@@ ded place where everyone who thinks he 's changed can see the truth ,
he 's been brought here from the C@@ enter .
let 's just say this is who I am , car@@ ing , compas@@ sion@@ ate .
the third is your pre-@@ death friend .
go , go , go ...
he 'll give us up as soon as possible .
he 's tar@@ g@@ eting Roy !
if they dis@@ cover it , we can all go bad .
- Wait !
I apologi@@ zed months ago .
why don 't you order a tur@@ key from Turkey ?
tell me you want to be legal .
a state university cli@@ mat@@ ology lab .
I 've read them about 20 times already .
I know why you left , I understand .
Mr. President .
that 's it !
- I think he 's in charge of robo@@ ts .
see , I 've gone too far .
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
how 's Daniel ?
I don 't know .
it 's not working anymore .
nobody move .
this is stupid .
where 's Jess ?
she 's giving birth to you , Ri@@ ple@@ y .
let 's go .
- Rachel !
rabbit 's leg .
too high .
want to see ?
- Come here .
good afternoon , Master .
William !
and this art was created in four mil@@ len@@ nia of E.@@ M@@ .@@ A ... 4000 years before Christ walked on Earth .
it 's as simple as that when it 's decided .
go and use your powers .
- Yes , " We or Ne@@ mad . "
I don 't have a rush to face justice , but I 'm pretty sure the outcome is , you whore ...
he 's the best .
then no one cares if it 's ...
just a minute .
it 's round .
there are also virtu@@ es for the little brother .
thank you .
I think it 's a great miracle that Mr. Norman Ma@@ ine is still playing in the movies .
are you kidding me ?
don 't touch him !
hurry up .
I know it sounds weird , but it used to be mine .
Hi , it 's me .
the one or the le@@ op@@ ard prin@@ t ?
sort of .
better than me .
this por@@ tion costs half my pay !
I really want us to be friends .
because it 's me .
I have a one-@@ way ticket .
I wouldn 't miss it .
how are you ?
he ju@@ mped out of the way .
he 's played you too many times .
Yeah .
Marcus B@@ oon@@ e .
right where I wanted to .
but , of course , it 's just a legend .
make sure the bird f@@ lies .
no , thanks .
pas@@ sage permits don 't let the co-@@ workers disappear in the lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th .
dad , enough !
and right now , President Taylor wants the peace agreement so badly that he 's ready to lie about the relationship between the Russians in today 's terrorist attack , and I can 't let that happen .
Bill ?
where is he ?
smel@@ ly little thing .
go !
bless you , L@@ ena .
let 's go get it .
nothing .
Harry , close the door .
what are you doing at school here ?
Mac@@ Kel@@ pie suffered mild inju@@ ries .
I think we found a problem .
- It 's over now .
my blood !
you 're acting like this guy 's doing you a favor or something .
now , if you 'll excuse me , I have a campaign to run .
it 's a friendly invitation .
there 's no reason why , no , what 's missing is the food I ordered 10 minutes ago , drinking as a fish ...
why San Francis@@ co ?
let 's go !
we should get out of here .
I never entered the numbers .
