is there a solution at last to avoid an@@ no@@ ying ro@@ b calls ?
for Michael R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , answ@@ ering the phone is a waste of time .
his report in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ os New E@@ ve , C@@ ity Pi@@ z@@ za Pu@@ b , depends on customers being generous and or@@ dering chicken w@@ ings , pizza and potato sal@@ ts .
however , much of the time is automatic messages that try to force fraud through .
the thing is reaching the blue zone , that it will not allow other g@@ low@@ ers to reach us , just now said the 2@@ 4-@@ year-old bar@@ tender owner .
help is on the way , though slowly .
over the last year , the government 's inspi@@ ration has been added to the J@@ ä@@ ä@@ s to block new tools to obstru@@ ct last year 's Bi@@ ble speeches .
F@@ ed@@ er@@ al Communic@@ ations Com@@ mis@@ si@@ on has proposed allowing telephone companies to use more spa@@ m speeches and to inti@@ mi@@ date fra@@ u@@ du@@ l@@ ent peti@@ tions with high fin@@ es .
according to experts , these steps are not a definitive solution , but they are a good start .
Federal and Par@@ tic@@ ular Le@@ gs should protect people from speeches by remote distribu@@ tors .
however , there is no interest in fra@@ ud@@ sters that they do not want to see the law .
fra@@ ud@@ sters reach people che@@ ap@@ ly from below and below , using the automa@@ ted elec@@ tors at the time , Ms 8 , which automatically makes speeches from Mr S@@ wa@@ mp at the same time .
it is estimated that millions of ro@@ b speeches per day will be made .
not all of them are , of course , fra@@ u@@ du@@ l@@ ent .
a@@ esthe@@ ts , for example , send out to comply with the prescri@@ ptions of Mo@@ der@@ n@@ é@@ g@@ é@@ n@@ é@@ g@@ é@@ n@@ é@@ n@@ é@@ g@@ és .
but often the situation is as follows : you are inde@@ b@@ ted to the IR@@ S ; Mic@@ ro@@ so@@ f spo@@ ils you to fix your computer ; you are offered free ch@@ ops !
in addition , jun@@ kies use sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated technology that shows on the phone either the number of ' 8 ' or ' the number of the important ' expres@@ sions ' , such as the ' IR@@ S ' .
in the case of the numbers to be used by Ms Dy@@ s@@ ste@@ m@@ my , the implementation of measures would make it difficult to de@@ ce@@ ive and would help to keep together millions of dollars in the United States , as stated in the document of the group of chief manag@@ ers of the States .
te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y companies and ™ har@@ b@@ ours can si@@ mu@@ late or sum@@ mari@@ ze speeches by comparing them with the known da@@ taba@@ ses of biological numbers and analy@@ sing suspic@@ ious behaviour , such as a number that cu@@ t@@ ters a lot of people in the descri@@ p@@ tive lists .
wi@@ rele@@ ss service providers also have tools that add warnings to in@@ coming speeches , such as the one called " l '@@ L@@ L " , but they are not available on all phones or on a large number of pre-@@ paid customers .
you can order them from V@@ eri@@ z@@ on and S@@ pr@@ in@@ ti for extra fees .
some of the And@@ ro@@ id phones , including 8,@@ i Pi@@ x@@ el , are scre@@ wing jun@@ k calls for free .
J@@ en Var@@ gas , a producer of the media , from Or@@ land@@ o F@@ l@@ or@@ ita , said that his application of A@@ T last night , marked and , last but not least , marked certain sca@@ ms in his gut , but , as far as telephone lines are concerned , he is creative .
I very rarely receive speeches from numbers that I do not know , Mr L@@ ä@@ i , said Var@@ gas .
applications such as Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il and N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o offer home phones free of charge , but « .
in the case of Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il , O@@ per@@ ator 8 main@@ tains conditional calls orien@@ ted towards last year , which will move the calls forward if there is no response to or a pre@@ occu@@ pied speech .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available for all domestic telephone providers and does not work with parents , cop@@ per telephone lines .
it is also possible to buy wi@@ pes , some of them le@@ f@@ to@@ ver ones , which spoke on the house phones of 8 8 8 .
V@@ eri@@ z@@ on will also test the suspic@@ ious calls from the va@@ ult of warnings on the number of home phones .
telephone companies are already able to make certain speeches that are fra@@ u@@ du@@ l@@ ent .
the F@@ c@@ c is the rules of the Fri@@ ends For@@ m@@ ö and the promise of other fra@@ u@@ du@@ l@@ ent speeches .
this means that V@@ eri@@ z@@ on can set off a du@@ ty-@@ free number that accep@@ ts calls for payment but never starts one .
operators would also be able to make speeches where they know they are not legitimate , such as 9@@ 11 gu@@ ideline numbers .
these rules still need to be brought to an end .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , a public order as@@ p@@ ir@@ ant of non-@@ prof@@ it-@@ min@@ ded consumers , called « they » , said that they were « Wil@@ d » , but they did not protect consumers from all speeches by « . »
firstly , there will be no wa@@ ke@@ -up lists for certain types of lu@@ min@@ ai@@ res , such as debt colle@@ ctors and political campaigns .
in addition , according to Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , the rules of the f@@ c would only cover counterfe@@ it numbers .
not all ro@@ b calls are meant to be ty@@ pho@@ id .
the consumer union wants telephone companies to make available free of charge to all consumers the tools for making speeches .
in the long-term perspective , the f@@ c industry supports efforts to confirm that it is indeed the spo@@ kes@@ man who it claims to be .
perhaps one day you will be able to see Hitler 's phone on screen as long as the spo@@ i@@ ler is legitimate .
the T@@ ele@@ fon@@ ic En@@ ter@@ prises lobb@@ y@@ ist U@@ .@@ S@@ . T@@ ele@@ co@@ m says it may take several years to introduce it , but it would be a powerful tool against ro@@ bo@@ th@@ el@@ ists .
the F@@ c@@ c is also looking for ways to stop following an@@ no@@ ying speeches to consumers who change numbers .
if you record yourself at the moment in the Du@@ mp@@ ling List , but you can then get yourself a new number , the distribu@@ tor might not know that and maybe start bo@@ thering me .
Ms R@@ ob@@ o@@ th@@ el@@ ista@@ s do not disappear anywhere , said A@@ ar@@ on F@@ os@@ s N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bo@@ st , the last of which was to hold calls for mobile phones and home phones .
they 're criminals , and they 'll find another way to by@@ pass any system .
but it 's our job to do this for them as much as possible .
there are a number of last resor@@ ts that consumers should take .
don 't answer the phone if you don 't know the number .
Yes , this is not , unfortunately , the case with speeches by companies like S@@ por@@ ts C@@ it@@ y last night .
inter@@ rupt the speeches by Mr L@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ r .
don 't talk back , don 't press any but@@ tons .
if you intera@@ ct with them , they can mark you as someone who will react and bury you under speeches by Mr J@@ ä@@ r .
if possible , block the number after the call .
use the speech Tech@@ ni@@ que doors .
if you have any concerns about privacy , check the application rules to see if it shares your voice or contact data with distribu@@ tors .
do not provide lu@@ min@@ ai@@ res with data such as a bank account or the number of lu .

the merger into a financial group called Lu@@ min@@ or of the D@@ N@@ B and Nor@@ de@@ a Tea@@ ms will only be held in the last quarter of this year , by Business Day .
the Common Legal Re@@ qu@@ est for D@@ oo@@ r T@@ u has been postpon@@ ed .
after the opening of the merger last summer , the banks called last summer so that the deal with TES@@ TI@@ C could remain in the second quarter .
the leader of D@@ N@@ B I@@ b said , however , that this was going to be put into the third quarter .
in particular , the Swedish financial inspection gave Lu@@ min@@ or additional guidelines for fulfilling the bank ’ s regional importance .

the mon@@ it@@ ori@@ zation of passenger traffic talks about the fact that , from the point of view of Eva , it is scar@@ cel@@ y possible to go back on the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ mbH tra@@ ins .
and our second route to Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d-@@ Peter@@ s@@ burg .
there are technical possibilities for this , both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of water re@@ m@@ nan@@ ts - Mr G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in said .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in also stated that there are already Russian tra@@ ins that can change the track w@@ id@@ th and continue to move on a European track w@@ id@@ th .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in considers it to be a prospe@@ ct because , at the moment , the people of St Peter@@ s@@ burg and the whole part of Russia have to drive through the Se@@ is@@ ure de de de B@@ last .

many Est@@ oni@@ ans already have a Thursday week without their own knowledge .
but not like they 're waiting , it 's business day .
this has been created by a modern procedure called the ' O@@ pen Ac@@ tor ' .
in the office of Se@@ in@@ te@@ ta , it is worth nearly 1.5 hours a day in the work@@ force , according to the image of the H@@ numer@@ ard Business Re@@ vi@@ e@@ w , that is , almost an entire working day a week .
however , if four or three rest days are taken into account by Thursday 's working week , this forced solution will be worse than that .
one and a half hours of working time have been de@@ voted to focus by family and by concentra@@ ting instead of the time spent by hob@@ bies or holi@@ days , by labour seg@@ ments , by ex@@ ci@@ tement and anxiety , and by the loss of work .
how do we finance the company ’ s family ?
in a changed society , there are opportunities for companies ' vehicles - more and more companies are also using ful@@ l-@@ length le@@ asing , or rather a statu@@ tory la@@ y@@ out , long-term author@@ s .
the le@@ asing and ren@@ tal of a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions , which include different obligations and obligations , but which often still give rise to the cause of S@@ wa@@ mp .
the independent company of the international author , Mr Vil@@ li , who opened up Estonia 's S@@ G & D , suggests that companies are moving more and more towards full le@@ asing , and the possibility of long-term ren@@ tal is increasingly being used .
the war has highlighted the main questions that , in seeking answers , it will be possible to choose the way in which the vehicle is used .
how many cars to use ?
the greatest difference between the ren@@ tal and the le@@ asing of the car is the time of use .
it is worth giving priority to a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term vehicle to use long-@@ time vehicles when the company has a plan to use commercial vehicles at the distance of " de la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
the For@@ mer car has a much shorter period of use than le@@ asing drinks , but many of the major author@@ s also offer a long-term author , where the ren@@ tal of a car takes place without Ali contracts and free return - the Gul@@ f introduced different ways of ren@@ ting a car .
who will be the owner of the vehicle ?
at the end of the standard contract , the tenant will be the owner of the car .
as regards full le@@ asing at the end of the le@@ asing period , it is possible , under the same or better conditions , to continue with the le@@ asing payment , with the same new vehicle , which corresponds to the needs of the company , at the end of the le@@ asing period , to say that , as consumer society is moving ever more and more towards the core of 8 , ownership of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company .
in addition , in the case of a ful@@ l-@@ time le@@ asing , there is a chance to buy a car on the basis of a wish and agreed terms .
however , the ren@@ tal option is not available and is only paid for the period of use .
the car le@@ is@@ ure generally takes place in Au@@ tom@@ obi@@ les and ren@@ ts a car from the I@@ ik@@ on@@ tor of the ren@@ tal companies .
the automo@@ tive represen@@ tations deal with the sale of vehicles , but they also offer le@@ asing and , in some cases , also the author .
however , the R@@ endi@@ es have the sole purpose of ren@@ ting them out .
the war said that the reasons for the use of the ren@@ tal service are different - many companies rent professional vehicles , plus the service is conveni@@ ent to use in com@@ missions , or when they are in or when their car is in Jonas .
with regard to Ame@@ tis@@ s , more and more of a full le@@ asing , which offers transparency of costs , time savings in the purch@@ asing , use and draw@@ back process of vehicles , and greater comfort in d@@ é@@ na@@ ge , introduced a sales and j@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ r driver , a le@@ asing officer .
every year , more and more companies use ful@@ l-@@ fle@@ dged le@@ asing on their own car block , like that on their spending and on their main business .
what is the coverage of the insurance at LE@@ N ?
whereas , in the case of a lea@@ sed car , cas@@ cade and road insurance are mandatory , the ren@@ tal car is mostly covered by a base insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to include , for example , accident insurance , the@@ ft insurance or full insurance . ty@@ re shi@@ fts and other agreed services to Mr Ő@@ ld .
when a conventional vehicle can be taken into any new vehicle , a ful@@ l-@@ fle@@ dged le@@ asing operation will help to select a vehicle that meets the company 's wishes and needs , including the function of the use by Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ r , he compared the fact that a ful@@ l-@@ fle@@ dged le@@ asing will certainly help to reduce costs associated with the company 's au@@ top@@ ar@@ ks .
the choice of Ms R@@ end@@ is@@ hes , however , depends on ~ and on the park of hire cars - different ren@@ tal companies offer both small and econo@@ mical vehicles in their own fleet for use in last week and a lu@@ x@@ uri@@ ous se@@ dan for business meetings in the Netherlands .
in the close ren@@ tal period , it may , of course , happen that the car requested has already been ren@@ ted out , but against this , the desired vehicle will be helped in the early stages .
when sele@@ cting between le@@ asing or ren@@ tal , it should first be made clear what its objectives are - how long is the desire to use the vehicle and what are the plans for the car .
it is certainly also wor@@ th@@ while to look carefully at the different conditions and obligations of services .
how a man built a the@@ me park that paid $ 51 million to his daughter .
one of T@@ e@@ x@@ as '@@ s- father discovered that there is no the@@ me park where his han@@ di@@ cap@@ ped daughter could play .
so he decided to build one .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N had just left the family of the B@@ asse@@ in when his 12-@@ year-old ty@@ rant M@@ organ came from other children playing in the water .
he tried to make friends with them , but they quickly left the b@@ asse@@ in .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N thinks they got scared because they don 't know how a person with a disability - Morgan has a five-@@ year-old ni@@ ti@@ list , and also a certain form of au@@ tism .
that didn 't mean to ha@@ unt him .
let 's go . let 's go . let 's go . let 's go . let 's go . let 's go .
meeting him always brings a smile to his mouth , and he certainly wants to pay .
but there have been many times where we haven 't been able to take him to different places , S@@ id , he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and his husband , Mag@@ gi@@ e . ~ From their parents where they could take their dau@@ gh@@ ters - somewhere where he would feel comfortable and others would feel good about him as well .
we reached the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place , Mr L@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N speaking .
so , in 2007 , he decided to build it himself .
the former re@@ al@@ tor sold out his home construction in 2005 to establish a non-@@ profit group of T@@ he Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ thi@@ on , a non-@@ profit group that helps people with dis@@ abilities .
then he started to create the world 's first most highly O@@ B@@ D the@@ me park , J@@ IA .
the chance to create a the@@ me park where everyone can do everything that can be played by people with no special or special features , Mr S@@ wa@@ mp , will be spoken of by H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he invited doctors , ther@@ ap@@ ists , parents and other people with dis@@ abilities and disability to consult on the facility .
they were set up in 10 hecta@@ res of abandoned care@@ ers in San An@@ ton@@ io T@@ ec@@ as .
the park called M@@ organ L@@ es W@@ on@@ der@@ land to@@ tal@@ led 34 million dollars ( G@@ BP 26 million ) and was opened in 2010 .
tra@@ cks include a fully u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous va@@ cu@@ um wheel , ad@@ ven@@ tures at eight pla@@ y@@ ground and a min@@ ir@@ on@@ g .
vis@@ itors often tell Har@@ t@@ man that they were only able to experience these attra@@ ctions for the first time .
there is also a car@@ ou@@ sel that has ru@@ ff@@ les for the lad@@ ders of S@@ wa@@ z@@ el S@@ ho@@ es , which are moving up and down be@@ side the animals .
however , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N acknowle@@ dges that the M@@ organ was first resistant to driving .
when we opened him , he didn 't dare go to it .
he didn 't understand why it was spin@@ ning and why the animals were moving up and down to S@@ wa@@ mp , saying H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
it 's been three years before M@@ organ agreed to go to the car@@ ou@@ sel .
at first , he was just standing on top of that J@@ ä@@ u , then he was on an animal , but we 're not going to run .
it was a slow process , but now he loves to drive it .
the top of something that scared him off would be a lot for him .
the small things achieved by playing make a big difference .
since its last ges@@ ture , M@@ organ A@@ ges W@@ on@@ der@@ land is more than a million people from 67 countries and 50 of all American members .
people with disability are disabled and entry is free of charge for anyone who has a medical condition .
I realized that M@@ organ was one of the lucky ones , because he has a lot of things he needs .
I didn 't want the price to be for other people with special features , sa@@ y@@ in ' H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
'@@ E@@ ach year we e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly produce ' , ' E@@ ve that we will lose at least a million dollars ( G@@ BP 750 000 ) ' , and we will have to return it with the help of the succes@@ ses and partners ' .
this year , the broad@@ ening the@@ me park , M@@ organ last year , Ms In@@ spi@@ ra@@ ti@@ on Iceland , the surface of a fully de@@ vo@@ id water@@ park called ‘ 8 ’ .
{ \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF }
so we decided to set aside the water park , T@@ M@@ A@@ N , speaking .
warm water has been used in some parts of D@@ EA to help vis@@ itors with muscle problems .
there are water@@ proof , mo@@ tors that work with pressure rather than bat@@ teri@@ es .
it 's possible to ride a boat on the river .
the water park to@@ tal@@ led $ 17 million ( G@@ BP 13 million ) .
last night , a man came to me on In@@ spi@@ ra@@ thi@@ on last night and just held my hand , talking about H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
let go of his son , who has serious special powers , and he started crying .
he said his son had never been able to play in water before .
Har@@ t@@ man claims that three par@@ ks are not disabled from every person in the West , and the park has exactly the effect it was hoping for .
this will help people to understand that , although we are different from certain visas , we are , in fact , exactly the last person to say ' bye ' .
I saw one of those girls go to another girl who wasn 't special . they started playing together .
that was a real bad@@ ass .
Har@@ t@@ man has no intention of opening up more par@@ ks , even though he has received a pos@@ ter and e-mail with hundreds of letters from S@@ wa@@ mp , who would also open up near his own park .
instead , in San An@@ ton@@ io , it is concentra@@ ting on special measures for young people to make education impossible .
I know that there are many different organisations that try elsewhere to build something like the M@@ organ@@ s W@@ on@@ der@@ land , and we will continue to work with them on the S@@ wa@@ mp .
he continues to take Morgan with him to play the the@@ me park - M@@ organ is now a cele@@ b@@ rity .
when he comes here , he 's like a rock star !
many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him , he can handle it well , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
M@@ organ , who is now 22 years old , is doing things better and better .
he 's talking more now , and most of his physical problems have been dis@@ connected with the operation .
we 're so big that he 's gotten this far in the middle of last night .
when M@@ organ visits the park , he likes to play the sw@@ ings and the sand@@ area most , with how much he has helped others .
M@@ organ knows that the park has been named after him , but I do not think he under@@ stands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
he does not understand that the way he has dealt with things in his life has made him a real source of inspi@@ ration by Mr S@@ me@@ ll .
a call to find drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in W@@ it@@ ton .
the police are trying to find two cars involving a 14-@@ year-old girl rape investigation .
the second was attacked in the W@@ it@@ ton region of Bir@@ min@@ gh@@ am@@ is on 26 July at around 2 : 00 ( B@@ S@@ T ) .
before that , he was ra@@ ped in W@@ it@@ ton 's T@@ hea .
with regard to the first deca@@ de , there has been an acc@@ us@@ ation against one ME@@ D@@ EA .
the British Transport Police would like to talk to two drivers as part of the investigation .
the police say the first car is a light paint se@@ dan .
Tony F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ je k , the senior inspe@@ ctor of U@@ uri@@ des , said : ' cause we have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked him up and then ra@@ ped him in the car . '
we would like to know what has been said during this conversation , and the driver may also know the important details that will come to hold us in the investigation of last night .
the driver of another vehicle , described as the red V@@ W Shar@@ an , was likely to have taken the victim home after being ra@@ ped twice , according to the police .
from a cancer nurse to a cat in G@@ en@@ ie last year 's cat
a rescu@@ ed cat that was in support of its own property during bone therapy would become the last year 's cat .
G@@ en@@ ie mbH was recognised as he dra@@ gged his owner , E@@ vi@@ e H@@ end@@ er@@ son ( 11 ) , from L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n , over six che@@ mis@@ try treatments .
E@@ vi@@ e mbH was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 6@@ th and the company of G@@ en@@ ie helped him cope with a number of painful operations , according to him , and with time spent in hospital .
the cat was recognised by the Ca@@ ts Pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on in London by the Ca@@ ts Ca@@ ts Pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on .
picture signature : E@@ vi@@ e said that the cat was there for him when he lost his j@@ uni@@ per hair because of che@@ mis@@ try .
I think he 's the best .
he deserves it .
he 's always been there for me , S@@ aid E@@ vi@@ e .
he came to my gy@@ p@@ sy j@@ ala , and he came to me next to my j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
he smel@@ led the cast and then ju@@ mped into the cou@@ ch to p@@ at my kne@@ e with his pa@@ ws .
when I was too sick to get friends to come out , or to go out , and I had to sit at home , he came to me , and it made me much ha@@ ppi@@ er , Uh , the great s@@ lop@@ py little guy .
E@@ vi@@ e says she has a special bond with her pet , which was hu@@ gely supportive of her when she lost her hair because of the exhaus@@ ting treatment .
well , it frea@@ ked me out because I had the brown hair of the old I@@ ts .
but since it was spring , G@@ en@@ ie was ha@@ iry the same way , and the fact that I lost my hair and G@@ en@@ ie 's own , trig@@ gered a little bit of all that shock .
E@@ vi@@ e 's father , Chris H@@ end@@ er@@ son , said that the cat has been a great distra@@ ction at I@@ ly@@ n@@ ch and how E@@ vi@@ e I@@ ll used to watch his bel@@ o@@ ved favorite video .
Ms E@@ vi@@ e was in hospital for over 300 days , so we spent time there from 8 , and it offered her something to wait for when she got home for a few days of value .
I was 11 years old saying : " l was boring him every day I was in the hospital , and my family said he was boring me , too . "
he 's my best friend , and I really don 't know what I 'd do without him .
a business group is driving the government from the back of Bre@@ x@@ it under transitional conditions , to a total of two thousand .
one of Britain 's largest business groups ur@@ ges the government to stop dancing around the peri@@ ph@@ ery of Bre@@ xine .
In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te of Di@@ re@@ c@@ tors ( last J@@ D ) called on the government to propose a transitional agreement with last but a few years , to make Bre@@ x@@ it smooth .
the government would create a divi@@ de between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements .
the group warned that there would be a short-term cha@@ otic fluctu@@ ation on the edge of the cli@@ ff at last .

the last deca@@ de has been presented by members of government as controversial as to how long the transition period will last and what this enta@@ ils .
the alig@@ nment of Ms Bre@@ x@@ it 's divi@@ de - the transitional options are set out as ' Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go .

however , Ger@@ ard Ly@@ ons , an econ@@ om@@ ist and group E@@ con@@ om@@ ists for Bre@@ x 's leading f@@ ig@@ uu@@ r , this week wor@@ ries at the edge of the cli@@ ff over S@@ tro@@ ke Bre@@ x@@ it as a talk by the provo@@ ca@@ tive acti@@ vis@@ ts of De@@ pres@@ sion of the Y@@ 2@@ K computer , re@@ minis@@ cent of the fear of the mil@@ lennium shift .
Mr Ham@@ mon@@ d warned in June : there will be a large amount of business investment , which will continue to be held by companies until businesses see - which is likely to result in these Me@@ as@@ ons .
Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ is@@ on , the head of Ms D EU and Ms Ő@@ l , said : Ms K@@ an@@ ts@@ ler has the right to be concerned about business investment brothers .
this is one of the most frequently sig@@ h@@ ted changes that must be dealt with in connection with Bre@@ xine , alongside the re@@ location of the EU .
the latter applies in particular to Members who are currently contemp@@ lating co-@@ location or re@@ location with mbH .
last but not least , Article 50 of the Agreement on last March 9 proposes a number of options , including the following :
the EUROPEAN E@@ CON@@ OM@@ IC EN@@ ER@@ G@@ Y
acceptance to remain in the remote EU 's T@@ en government
establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU customs authorities
Ren@@ is@@ on said , with regard to the transition , they proposed these options , that they would ig@@ ni@@ te an appropriate debate on how best to bring Bre@@ x to a conclusion .
the sel@@ f@@ - up of the Ms and , therefore , the risks of exit from the EU mean that the cha@@ otic fluctu@@ ations on the edge of the cli@@ ff will not diminis@@ h the opportunities of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .

professional sport stands at the cross@@ roads : some areas have travel@@ led so far on the initiative that they are too busines@@ s-@@ cen@@ t@@ red to get under sport ;
others are returning to a world of am@@ our@@ ists , which is too spor@@ adi@@ c to be considered a business .
this was ham@@ pe@@ red by the painful delays in reaching a wage agreement with players , by the in@@ decision of the Ste@@ war@@ t Association ( report ) Tea@@ m Wil@@ d , by the I@@ mpa@@ ct Li@@ f@@ ö@@ der@@ ation ( ff@@ a ) î@@ u , by the difficulties of the ru@@ g@@ by Lea@@ gue in putting together an independent committee and by the in@@ determin@@ ate attempts to be a social flag carrier among the population .
the investment ban@@ ker and the Cha@@ ir of the S@@ port Committee , John W@@ y@@ li@@ e , have tried to ste@@ er the Olympic report actively on the path of professional Lea@@ gues ' by putting busines@@ s@@ men in manag@@ erial positions who do not have eli@@ te experience in sport .

the President of the C@@ a David Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r is the former CE@@ O of Ri@@ o tin@@ to A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia and he hired the head and advis@@ or of Ri@@ o tin@@ to to assist CA@@ .
however , it would be mis@@ taken to think that the eli@@ te , whose approach is ru@@ thless in dealing with cri@@ cket players , does not love this sport .
Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r , for example , was a regular vis@@ itor to S@@ wa@@ b 's home games until he moved to another country .
nevertheless , negotiations between the C@@ a and the AC@@ A and the extremely high T@@ EA have given the impression that the summer pet reference now belongs more to business than to sport .
on the contrary , the former Man@@ ag@@ ing Cha@@ ir of S@@ wa@@ mp , Cam@@ er@@ on C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , Cam@@ er@@ on C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , de@@ pu@@ tiz@@ ed A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ by 's team too much back to its roots .

R@@ ag@@ bi@@ li@@ it he@@ sita@@ tes that they have the most qualified and open-@@ min@@ ded management in L@@ AS , but the exces@@ ses in meeting the requirements of international partners show that this is still too much of a sport to be a business .
both the ru@@ g@@ by Lea@@ gue and S@@ un have problems with Ms , because they demand more power .
both Lea@@ gue cha@@ ir@@ men , John G@@ ran@@ t AR@@ L@@ C and Ste@@ ven L@@ o@@ w@@ y ff@@ a , have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve the in@@ he@@ rent stability of Ms L@@ o@@ w@@ y .

it became a value when the fre@@ sh@@ ly formed AR@@ L@@ C needed last last last year 's Day .

the way in which the members of the board of professional spor@@ ting areas are appointed is to take prece@@ dence over the judgment of the Bureau of Wil@@ d spor@@ ting Ter@@ ri@@ tories .

moreover , many M@@ ist@@ ress hea@@ v@@ y@@ we@@ ights are not used to the intensive and sometimes personal obser@@ va@@ tory of the media .
something that works in the world of S@@ wa@@ mp may not be transferred to the field of sport .

on Thursday T@@ ele@@ v@@ isi@@ on C@@ ri@@ ti@@ cs As@@ so@@ ci@@ a@@ tion@@ i was announced by Ju@@ h@@ ti@@ v@@ produ@@ c@@ t D@@ an F@@ eight el@@ man as part of the series that the N@@ B@@ C in the run@@ -up to the next season is to be set up by Mr Sta@@ l@@ one .
the ac@@ tor wal@@ ks up as a Cy@@ cl@@ inic on the film ima@@ ges at the beginning of the season 7 , of K@@ e@@ vin ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Har@@ tle@@ y ) .
Mr K@@ e@@ v@@ in plays in a big movie , and we needed a big com@@ memor@@ ation of ' s- ' s ' , ' F@@ last el@@ man ' .
at the end of the last season , K@@ e@@ v@@ in was hired to play a part in a series of spe@@ cta@@ cular spe@@ l@@ ls of R@@ on Howard 's sta@@ ged film .
during this season , we will see the character involved in the activities of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O , and the war@@ m@@ th will also be up@@ held by his ex-@@ wife , who is played by Ale@@ x@@ and@@ ra B@@ rec@@ k@@ en@@ ri@@ dge .
according to F@@ publika el@@ man , Sta@@ l@@ l@@ l@@ one 's film , in which K@@ e@@ v@@ in participa@@ tes , plays is@@ af@@ ig@@ u@@ ri mbH .
the star of our lives , Mil@@ o V@@ enti@@ tega lia , who plays Har@@ tle@@ y 's father in the ima@@ ges of the past , played as a coincidence in 2006 's film with S@@ ons of Ro@@ ck@@ y Bal@@ bo@@ a last year .
F@@ publika el@@ man said that the still f@@ l@@ our@@ ishing friendship with Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one Te was probably the one that helped the show to be the guest ac@@ tor of the great star .
we have an excellent scenario for him .
I think it 's gonna be a really exciting last night , called the F@@ lise@@ r el@@ man .
~ O@@ ur life ~ will return to the television scre@@ ens on September 26@@ th .
J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on spen@@ ds about $ 300@@ ,000 a year to keep his body in a pla@@ y@@ form .
every player in the N@@ I@@ ES depends on his own body to serve .
that is why many other a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , too , are investing money on body care and reconstruction in order to maintain excell@@ ence .
Je@@ re@@ m@@ y F@@ o@@ w@@ ler S@@ al ES@@ P@@ N@@ .@@ co@@ m looked more closely at how far some ve@@ ter@@ ans are ready to go to extend their care@@ ers .
however , no case is as extreme as that of a 3@@ 9-@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ rison , preparing for the 14@@ th season on the Bac@@ k@@ line protection line of the Dou@@ g@@ h S@@ tee@@ lers .
according to the F@@ o@@ w@@ es , Har@@ ris@@ on spen@@ ds over $ 300 000 a year on a s@@ l@@ ope , mas@@ sage phase , chi@@ ro@@ pra@@ ctor and d@@ ome pan@@ das .
the majority of the costs are related across the country to meet with J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ r .
well , I don 't have to keep a record of things like this one , sa@@ y@@ in ' Har@@ ris@@ on .
as a comparison of the sums ear@@ ned with my expenditure , S@@ ighs are worth it , given how I feel .
M@@ ike I@@ l , Har@@ rison 's training partner , and Hit@@ man at S@@ tee@@ lers , valu@@ ed $ 200@@ ,000 a year to take care of his body .
at 30 years of age , the body has been tested by the body ’ s body ’ s yar@@ n ( in English by « bo@@ dy tem@@ per@@ ing » ) , which is the use of F@@ o@@ w@@ ler ’ s as « up to 55 kil@@ o ’ s metal as a mas@@ sage powder by 8 .
instead of rolling on top of it , it 's gonna be rol@@ led on you ... at the top of last night 's speech ... - ... sa@@ y@@ m ... - ... sa@@ y@@ m ... - ... sa@@ y@@ in ' ...
when you have a ten@@ se spot on your leg and they start moving this thing around , it 's a pain .
but when you get up , S@@ id will be gone .
it 's just beating ' em out .
they are prepared to make further efforts , but the former N@@ I@@ E players , Bar@@ ry Co@@ field and R@@ y@@ an Har@@ ris , on average , a year for a recovery of 50 000 dollars .
Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d , who played 10 seas@@ ons in the ran@@ ks of New York Gi@@ ants and Washington I@@ ts , has stated that he will not do more .
as long as I could go back , I would go back to S@@ z@@ el , Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d said to F@@ o@@ w@@ ler .
I would probably spend at least twice as much .
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career .
to the end , perhaps there would have been some help with more procedures such as the ' no ' procedure .
R@@ y@@ an S@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old rea@@ r defen@@ sive player , mbH to step in the foot@@ steps of his ve@@ ter@@ ants from S@@ tee@@ lers .
when you pay $ 100@@ ,000 and make an extra $ 3 million to play , then that decision is quite simple , S@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ er said .
as for the long-term career sub@@ sis@@ tence , the recovery of players in ZY@@ P@@ AD@@ H@@ ERA is much more effective than spending money on cars and villa@@ ges .
the average player in N@@ A@@ M will be lucky if he can play for more than 30 years of age , all the more so Har@@ rison 's success should convince his colleagues to spend on another place .
but maybe they can just find a few local T@@ ic .
how the pr@@ in@@ ce@@ ss Diana used her make@@ up as a weapon
when I think of Diana 's make@@ up , the eye mark@@ er comes before the eyes of the first I@@ ke .
a younger age , a girl 's baby blue .
later , his Martin Bas@@ hi@@ r - Pan@@ or@@ ama - an inter@@ v@@ ha@@ us , the effects of which were devasta@@ ting when he looked up the th@@ umb@@ s of the th@@ umb@@ s - would be a famous im@@ mor@@ tal ph@@ rase : there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a little too crow@@ ded , too crow@@ ded .
big and wet eyes surroun@@ ded by his s@@ kin@@ ny face with a th@@ ick black line made him look like a w@@ ounded animal .
that 's the effect he was trying to achieve .
outside the public , however , the pr@@ in@@ ce@@ ss Diana never produces much make@@ up , at least not according to modern standards .
it was not only that he did not need it - he was , of course , a beauty - but he saw it as an an@@ no@@ ying obligation , something that relates to work rather than pleasure .
in public , he could wear a fat make@@ up .
once he arrived at the office of the Con@@ de N@@ as@@ ti , V@@ o@@ gu@@ e '@@ i publis@@ hers , wearing a th@@ ick , almost orange hair dres@@ ser .
he apologi@@ zed to say his lea@@ ther had to get s@@ kin@@ ny like from the d@@ war@@ f , because if he would go out with ty@@ pically de@@ li , then his cur@@ ve photogra@@ ph@@ ers would photogra@@ ph him , and then everyone would present to me that he looks like 1 8 : 00 , 1 : 00 , 2 : 00 , 2 : 00 , 2 : 00 , 2 : 00 .
it is for this very reason that Diana visited sol@@ ari@@ um three times a week , using at her own home with the latter .
no@@ wa@@ days , of course , this kind of action would be an@@ no@@ yed for health reasons , but for Diana , it was a useful objective - that is , to show the world his el@@ f j@@ ä@@ ä@@ i - even though his inte@@ ri@@ or was filled with black clou@@ ds and th@@ under .
one of the most likely mistakes of the ro@@ yal family was to think that , if they approve her as a husband of C@@ har@@ les , they would have a beautiful little family with nothing but a cotton cotton cotton c@@ andy .
what happened to him was last night ?
he may not have been the best in the class , but when it comes to creating an im@@ ag@@ o from the school , he was a five-@@ year-old student .
for Diana , the importance of hair and make@@ -up was that they could be used to con@@ vey a mood or a feeling .
otherwise , he will not be interested in them .
her friend R@@ osa Mon@@ ck@@ ton , Diana , was the mother of her youn@@ gest child ... re@@ members that we were nothing they used to talk about .
all I remember is that last night , he said how much I thought he felt when we went to buff@@ et together and he didn 't think he was make@@ up .
no@@ wa@@ days , we think of make@@ up as something that impro@@ ves a woman 's out@@ look , but looking back at Diana 's habi@@ tat , it 's obvious she used it as a powerful tool for public relations .
these moments , when he felt the most free , were the most of his own , are the moments when he was also the most natural , wearing very little make@@ up .
in 199@@ 3 , with his two boys running down at the T@@ hor@@ pe de park of lo@@ g@@ g@@ ers Le@@ ap@@ i attra@@ ction , he was so@@ a@@ ked and s@@ mil@@ ing , and he was sc@@ at@@ tered in the ey@@ eb@@ al@@ ls like any other mother who spen@@ ds the day with children .
four months after the announcement of his and C@@ har@@ les ' brea@@ kup , he finally saw a de@@ fi@@ ance of une@@ as@@ y and common labour .
or , in later years , evi@@ den@@ ced from the tre@@ en@@ ess , the Je@@ ws in the back , in the form of the legs in stage ' s , the face of the tra@@ il , the health and the life force explo@@ de in each of his po@@ res .
at the end of his life , when he started to pay his J@@ A@@ s and his confidence grew , we saw more and more of this Di@@ ana .
she was acting with H@@ al@@ o T@@ rust and s@@ oun@@ ding through the Mi@@ ol@@ a field in January 1997 .
at the time , at the age of 45 , Je@@ wish soft and natural , almost completely free of make@@ up , he probably looked more beautiful than when he looked up earlier , re@@ member@@ ing that g@@ lowing , rich young girl who lau@@ g@@ hed at an engagement photo 15 years ago .
Diana was just about to get to her last few years .
in the early days , young Diana S@@ pen@@ c@@ eri had a sleeping dream of Pre@@ -@@ R@@ aff@@ ae@@ li@@ -@@ Vi@@ ani .
however , it did not take long to start the pr@@ in@@ ces@@ sing of José - the process of conduc@@ ting a deal mainly with p@@ ress and pal@@ ace to make Di@@ ana a ra@@ ff@@ ed young vir@@ gin who would be worth his new drink .
it partly involved C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Howard , a ve@@ ter@@ an make@@ -up writer , who was often used by I@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on on on photogra@@ phic communications .
Ho@@ w@@ ard first met with A@@ b Di@@ ana in S@@ no@@ w@@ don Ken@@ sing@@ ton City time to ice maga@@ zine for V@@ o@@ gu@@ e an official engagement picture .
at that point , at the end of the 198@@ 0s , Diana was just a blan@@ k sh@@ ri@@ mp .
his fin@@ est beauty products were from T@@ he Bo@@ dy S@@ h@@ op@@ i , for example , in the eyes of El@@ der@@ f@@ lo@@ wer .
Ho@@ w@@ ard used Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor 's make@@ up cre@@ mp S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us T@@ ON@@ I@@ 1 H@@ one@@ y mbH and Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor with a tone of F@@ ro@@ sted C@@ ory .
to the ey@@ el@@ as@@ hes , he wor@@ e a table@@ clo@@ th with the E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den T@@ own R@@ ic@@ e and Tim@@ ber@@ land and the ey@@ e@@ bro@@ w with a white fro@@ sted fun@@ nel .
out of nowhere , E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den 's blue ey@@ el@@ ash and blue account sto@@ ve .
and we know all this because Ho@@ w@@ ard created a fac@@ ial sna@@ ck for him .
the eyes of Diana are such a sy@@ l@@ la@@ ble color that I would s@@ mas@@ h their s@@ tun@@ ning blue tongue to point out to me at a later date .
with a girl like this , then , he 's not very fla@@ t@@ tering - he looks like an 18@@ -@@ year-old who 's 8 : 50 .
his ey@@ e@@ bro@@ ws are too op@@ pres@@ sive and too much boring brown .
the most stri@@ king of all is here , however , the no@@ tori@@ ous mes@@ sen@@ ger at the inner edge of the ey@@ eli@@ d in that cree@@ py D@@ is@@ ne@@ y pr@@ in@@ tse@@ s@@ si musta@@ rd tone .
the F@@ an@@ ta@@ asi@@ a@@ th@@ on on the fan@@ tas@@ y square .
there 's no reason why Diana 's looking a little pre@@ car@@ i@@ ously at us .
one of the sources of Diana 's anxiety was the fact that she never knew where the public per@@ zone would end and private life would begin .
it was the beginning of this process .
the person most likely to express Diana was M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el , who is still playing an important role in today 's make@@ -up world .
the Me@@ ig@@ ar@@ ist , who is currently an en@@ vo@@ y of C@@ han@@ el , among others , is still one of the make@@ up without the i@@ con@@ s .
the Di@@ ana had a beautiful lea@@ ther , and last night 's th@@ umb@@ s , just like last night .
he was just gor@@ geous .
the men ad@@ ored him .
he was sexy without trying to do it with him .
M@@ ary met with Di@@ ana for the first time in 199@@ 1st , when V@@ o@@ gu@@ e last time , Anna Har@@ ve@@ y asked her to make a make@@ up for Diana before December with one of the most appreci@@ ated photogra@@ ph@@ ers of one of the maga@@ z@@ ines Pat@@ ľ@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ li@@ er e@@ til .
S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t was also a ha@@ ir@@ dres@@ ser .
this was when Diana and C@@ har@@ les ' marri@@ ages were the biggest and the fight for public I@@ ts began .
they did not tell us who it was , even though we knew it was someone very famous , Mr S@@ me@@ ll , who G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l said .
when we got there , Diana was just standing there beautiful , warm and friendly , and extremely excited to be on the top of V@@ o@@ gu@@ e Mi@@ j@@ i .
this image of Diana , in simple terms , was b@@ ent away by sti@@ ff , s@@ l@@ ope rel@@ ying on her hands , her blue eyes w@@ rap@@ ped , her finger@@ na@@ ils e@@ leg@@ ant French man@@ ic@@ ure , the Je@@ ws at the sex cut , was gro@@ un@@ ded .
it was full of posi@@ tivity , person@@ ality and e@@ leg@@ ality .
first and foremost , it was a fea@@ ther of the nin@@ th of th@@ ie@@ ves con@@ fer@@ ring on their cla@@ n '@@ é@@ ral a@@ esthe@@ tics and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the ro@@ yal family , who had to face the battle at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of ~ ~ ~ like the Queen at a later date ~
Diana was very free about her make@@ up .
he just wanted to look fresh and last night , said G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el .
over time , he taught Di@@ ana his own make@@ up - cre@@ me , make@@ up cre@@ me , a stic@@ ker of the eyes , called ' E@@ yes ' ' ' ' ' , and under@@ lined the s@@ kin@@ ny routine of « skin care » by encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the man@@ tra in the inner beauty of « .
Diana Jos@@ si did everything moder@@ ately , says G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
he had enough and reduced consumption of alcohol , which is very important for the skin of fresh expression .
the pr@@ in@@ ce@@ ss preferred the Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in make@@ -up cre@@ me , C@@ lar@@ ins ' po@@ t@@ p@@ our@@ ri , and last night 's Wil@@ d Ro@@ se che@@ ek .
but the biggest favor M@@ ary did to Di@@ ana was her we@@ an@@ ing off the blue eye mark@@ er .
well , it just made him so much older , he said .
instead , he used a combination of soft brown and le@@ mon@@ ade ton@@ es with a brown lead line on the ey@@ el@@ ash line that was cou@@ ple@@ d to each other , so all the ed@@ ges were beau@@ ti@@ fully soft .
he was just using a th@@ ick sh@@ ri@@ mp and a little so@@ lar powder to underline Diana I@@ ts ' g@@ lit@@ ch .
Diana used to be gen@@ tle to me and invite me to discuss products that I liked to do very much , G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l told me .
I think it was brea@@ th@@ taking for him ; a chance to take a few moments to myself .
his lem@@ mi@@ k was a lu@@ x@@ uri@@ ous k C@@ lar@@ in@@ s .
Diana has alle@@ ge@@ dly used day and night foods and cleaning milk and ton@@ er with these Al@@ pine her@@ bs intended for sensitive skin and these Al@@ pine her@@ bs .
she was also regular fac@@ ial care in L@@ i d '@@ Jan@@ et F@@ il@@ der@@ man .
Diana had a famous beautiful lea@@ ther , but sometimes she had ro@@ sa@@ ce@@ a pigs , a moderate che@@ ek@@ bones , which is caused by stress .
he used na@@ tur@@ all@@ y-@@ cal@@ ming oils , including chi@@ bu@@ vi@@ c oil , to alle@@ vi@@ ate this .
Di@@ ana had a mag@@ nific@@ ent skele@@ ton structure , sa@@ y@@ in ' G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el .
the only part of his appearance that he wasn 't very confident about was his nose .
Anna Har@@ ve@@ y remin@@ ds me : ' cause once the newspa@@ pers wrote that she had been in a beauty operation with Nina , she turned to me and said , frankly , if I had my nose bea@@ ten , do you think I would have chosen one ?
when the advice of M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t began to be en@@ tren@@ ched , Diana was feeling more and more confident about her new appearance .
one of his most memor@@ able public statements - in 1994 , in a London Ser@@ pen@@ tine K@@ id G@@ alle@@ ry , where he wor@@ e the famous K@@ IA re@@ tribu@@ tion dress , a challen@@ ging f@@ ig@@ ure with b@@ are shoul@@ ders from Chris@@ tina Sta@@ mb@@ oli@@ an - shows that he began to develop a sig@@ nal@@ ling pattern for the years of his life .
with short and side@@ -@@ ha@@ ir@@ -@@ cut hair , Diana is at the same time mixed and last night 's hair , her short ha@@ ir@@ cut in sharp contrast with a highly challen@@ ging black sil@@ k dress .
his mei@@ k is perfect - fla@@ t@@ tering , yet hu@@ mble , black ey@@ e@@ mak@@ er insis@@ ting on his eyes .
fe@@ ar@@ less col@@ ors , especially red ones , he used to carry the sh@@ iny red cla@@ ws , quite probably a Re@@ v@@ l@@ on ra@@ di , which then became a kind of ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ... A ...
a few months later , he flas@@ hed his e@@ leg@@ ant red man@@ ic@@ ure from the Chil@@ d De@@ ath Fund in the Ro@@ yal E@@ ven@@ ing ges@@ ture .
the pr@@ inc@@ es@@ ses were a stage of health and self-@@ confidence .
and finally , he had complete control .
sun@@ ken and fit , his mei@@ k ve@@ j@@ i , he con@@ ve@@ ys exactly what he wants the people of A@@ 8 to think : there is a woman here who finally seems to have a sense of sense and purpose in life and who , at last , has just gotten 36 , has found her place .
it 's a real shame he couldn 't prove it to himself .
Ms A@@ F war@@ ns that peti@@ tions will be closely monitored in the World Trade Organisation competi@@ tions .
the World A@@ ca@@ de@@ my Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships start in London , and the S@@ piri@@ ts are more exposed than ever to the d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als .
these World O@@ per@@ ations are the first to be guar@@ ded by a new body , A@@ th@@ le@@ ti@@ cs In@@ teg@@ ri@@ t@@ y E@@ un ( A@@ I@@ U ) , which also mon@@ itors corruption , gambling and the fal@@ si@@ fication of results .
it cannot be ruled out that the nature of people does not allow such things to happen .
however , we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-@@ d@@ ope programme that can now be based on information and data ga@@ thering , and we will see the outcome after the event in A@@ I@@ U , Mr Ho@@ w@@ man , said .
A@@ I@@ U has allowed the 19@@ th wave of approximately 19@@ 0 Russian 8 children caught with dro@@ o@@ gs to tic@@ k when they were kids from last last night .
the lea@@ king of tru@@ mp trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts is probably a federal offen@@ se , according to the words of J@@ ä@@ r .
the lea@@ ked to the press by the trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts between President tru@@ mp and foreign leaders was probably committed by Mr S@@ wa@@ mp , on Thursday , when the legis@@ lators called on the defend@@ ant to find out .
the una@@ u@@ th@@ ori@@ sed disclosure of these documents to the press is a criminal offence by the former C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia cir@@ cus , Jo@@ e di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws .
these differ from S@@ EA , which involves publis@@ hing notes of conver@@ sa@@ tions between the President and foreign leaders and their trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts , constitutes a serious threat to M@@ u .
the Washington Po@@ st announced , on the basis of the documents which took place on Thursday last night , the ten@@ se speeches with the Mexic@@ an President , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ EN@@ A N@@ ie@@ to , and last night with Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l .
the first order was to stop the Mexic@@ an head of state alle@@ ge@@ dly declar@@ ing that his government would not pay for border drugs .
according to the newspa@@ per , the trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts contained notes indicating that they were secret by the head of the National Lor@@ ds .
the Po@@ st said that the complete trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts that had been asse@@ mb@@ led by the workers of the White House in d@@ é@@ j@@ à on notes by the White House .
there is a federal rule of law that makes this kind of secret information about lea@@ king to an una@@ u@@ th@@ ori@@ sed person , feder@@ alist Daw@@ es , said the former New York state , Mr D@@ ou@@ g Bur@@ ns , on the phone inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ers .
although some of these speeches have already come out in the open of the few , the disclosure of the trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts marks a much greater mark on the White M@@ a@@ ja , who is trying to reduce the number of ima@@ ges .
the report just happened at a time when the tru@@ mp@@ i direc@@ tory f@@ ig@@ ers were preparing to step up vigor@@ ously with the public in order to show their secret information to the emer@@ gence of lea@@ kers .
Prime Minister ri J@@ ef@@ f S@@ es@@ sion@@ s , National Director D@@ an Co@@ ats , As@@ sis@@ tant General R@@ od Ro@@ sen@@ stein , and National In@@ telli@@ gence and Security Centre : Wil@@ li@@ am E@@ van@@ ina , quick to fami@@ li@@ arise the public with the situation of the judi@@ ci@@ ary at last .
it 's not clear whether the Ministry of Justice is investi@@ gating the lea@@ k of T@@ he Po@@ st .
in order to take someone for this , according to Bur@@ ns ’ s words , it will be necessary to clearly prove last last night .
he said that on this subject , there could be some kind of has@@ s@@ le on the subject of the investigation and the decision not to prosecu@@ te the findings of the former Secretary of State , H@@ ill@@ ary mbH .
these considerations include the label and history of the document and its classi@@ fications by Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ r .
in the event of secrecy , the L@@ ik@@ ers shall examine whether the document was lea@@ ked to an una@@ u@@ th@@ ori@@ sed person in a way which affects the interests of the United States of America .
as proof of all of this , M@@ ist@@ ress , people can undoubtedly be in a crimin@@ ally defen@@ ce@@ less position , Mr S@@ pea@@ king Bur@@ ns said .
- There 's no ja@@ b .
when it comes to the trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ts of the tru@@ mp phone calls , the di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was Vic@@ ti@@ ms ' r , said that such documents were usually classified as a secret and a ta@@ ver@@ n .
to put them in the hands of the United States Government 's ability to run A@@ 2 , the di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va head@@ line , I@@ ike , asked me to sum@@ mon a federal criminal ju@@ ry to find the lea@@ kers .
he also said that a court order should be presented to obtain letters from the re@@ por@@ ters of T@@ he Washington Po@@ st and the number of people on the phone - something against which the re@@ por@@ ters would no doubt begin .
U@@ TA@@ H - the Re@@ publi@@ can Sen@@ ator M@@ ike Le@@ e - said on Thursday in C@@ ap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill that criminal proceedings should take place in the case of lea@@ kage of classified information .
the person who lea@@ ked them must be found - he must be punished and , in addition , he must be fired by I@@ ke , said Le@@ e F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws on the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a last night , Ne@@ w@@ s H@@ Q 8 .
this is unacceptable , and such a thing should never be allowed to happen to you .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before he said in 2010 to Sen@@ ti@@ tis@@ se S@@ wa@@ it@@ z , said that such a lea@@ k was a crime against S@@ wa@@ b , a very serious federal offen@@ se called S@@ wa@@ mp .
with such a piece of work , Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ i should not , and should not only , go to bed , but also criminal proceedings , given that confidential information was involved , he spoke .
it was said to F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws that , at this stage , the announcement by the Justice Department of Re@@ volu@@ tion could provide an over@@ view of what the Ministry of Justice could achieve rather than explain the proceedings .
last week , President S@@ es@@ sion@@ s sp@@ il@@ led his anger open@@ ly on top of chief d@@ é@@ j@@ our , Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ r , that the latter has not made enough effort to find the le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs .
I want the Prime Minister to be much tou@@ g@@ her with regard to lea@@ kage from the security agencies , Mr I@@ ce , said a dru@@ m@@ p on 25 July in the rose garden .
S@@ es@@ si@@ ons himself last week F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws Tu@@ c@@ ker Car@@ l@@ s@@ ė , that he is not satisfied with the lea@@ ks that , since his in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration , have repeatedly been erec@@ ted by 8 .
I have not been satisfied with the procedures and inqu@@ iri@@ es of the criminal lea@@ ks in Ő@@ si , said se@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ s .
even some people have spoken out against lea@@ ks , saying that this type of action is detri@@ mental to foreign policies .
the lea@@ king of speech trans@@ kri@@ p@@ ti between the President and the head of the foreign state is impossible , last week 's Day , last night 's speech by David f@@ ru@@ m in at@@ lan@@ ti@@ c@@ us .
it is of the utmost importance that L@@ ob@@ es be able to respond confi@@ denti@@ ally - and perhaps even more importantly , for foreign leaders to understand that they can respond confi@@ denti@@ ally to j@@ ä@@ j@@ i .
Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner ( D@@ -@@ V@@ a ) , the lead democra@@ t of the Sen@@ ate Security Committee , also told T@@ he Da@@ il@@ y B@@ e@@ as@@ ti that the lea@@ k was a lea@@ k at the end of the day , and that the address should be investigated .
the ve@@ tera@@ n of the United States Na@@ vy has been ordered to remove an American flag w@@ rap@@ per from the ma@@ il@@ box .
at the centre of the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da Ho@@ me@@ land Union between the ve@@ tera@@ n of the United States and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da is an American flag ma@@ il@@ box .
John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , the com@@ mander of the United States Na@@ vy , says that he received a letter from the Union of the S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood Community last week from T@@ al@@ lah@@ as@@ see asking him to remove or face punishment from the ma@@ il@@ box .
he told the W@@ C@@ TP he wasn 't going to surrender without a fight , and he 's made an appeal .
to be honest with you , I take it as a ki@@ j@@ i j@@ ä@@ i , said A@@ ck@@ er@@ t .
and I think people should fight whatever form they want , especially with someone like that .
A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that the Alliance of Home Affairs claims that its ma@@ il@@ box is not in line with the S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood a@@ esthe@@ tics .
the United States Na@@ vy ve@@ tera@@ n John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that he was ordered to remove the American fla@@ gged w@@ rap@@ per from his ma@@ il@@ box .
due to the end of the Olympic season , we ask you to remove from the ma@@ il@@ box the symbol of the American flag , I@@ -- it sent a letter .
the shel@@ f life may be out 30 days before and should be taken off within 15 days at the latest .
he said the cover 's been out for four years .
it got put in there 30 days after the house moved .
the messages from the S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood List did not receive an answer in last morning .
some A@@ ck@@ ert ber said to W@@ C@@ TV that the letter was a little har@@ sh , and they were not particularly surprised by the action of the Home Union .
~ They do things like that all the time ~ ~ ~ M@@ ike Ste@@ p@@ h@@ en@@ son said .
I think it 's ridiculous .
why can 't you be patri@@ otic ?
M@@ ike P@@ A@@ T@@ EL said : it is a ve@@ tera@@ n who served our country .
it 's just a ma@@ il@@ box with a flag .
I don 't think that 's right .
he ow@@ ns the house , at least he could .
the letter from the Home Union states that A@@ ck@@ ert has 15 days to remove the surroun@@ dings , otherwise he will be fined .
he has not received an answer to his appeal .

report : Mu@@ el@@ ler sum@@ mon@@ ed a ju@@ ry in an investigation relating to Russia .
the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et Journal announced on Thursday that a special team investi@@ gating possible links between Russia and D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp in I@@ bi@@ am@@ pa@@ ania has conven@@ ed a ju@@ ry .
the paper states that the ju@@ ry is a new and significant ju@@ ry body in its research on whether the dru@@ m@@ p or its main ad@@ vi@@ sers were a secret con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy with Moscow in order to promote the I@@ mp@@ lon@@ ia of Si@@ x@@ th Re@@ public@@ ans .
the N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has previously announced that before Mu@@ el@@ ler , the former director of the F@@ B@@ I , who is now leading this critical investigation , was appointed , the National Gu@@ ards had used the homes of the elderly as part of the investigation into the activities of Michael F@@ l@@ y@@ nn and the former head of the campaign , Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ t .
one of the President 's personal lawyers , John D@@ O@@ W@@ D , told N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws that he was una@@ ware that Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using the ju@@ ry .
we have been working together with Bo@@ b Mu@@ el@@ le@@ ys and his last name since 1 June , because we want to get this over with with , he said .
against the background of sum@@ mon@@ ing the Federal Ju@@ dge Assembly itself , we have no reason to believe that the President 's dru@@ m@@ p is under investigation into I@@ ke .
N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has not confirmed J@@ our@@ n@@ al 's data independently .
the use of the ju@@ ry as a whole is part of a complex investigation , and it is not a tool aimed only at hearing for an hour , but also of information from individuals or businesses as well as information from the person or business as the case may be .
this is a powerful tool that the L@@ ob@@ es can use to apply for prosecu@@ tions and sum@@ mons , and it might indicate that Mu@@ el@@ de@@ lis 's work has not yet been done .
the dru@@ m@@ p is the th@@ um@@ b that he or some of his crew members held a plan with Russia during the period of last 6@@ th ik@@ am@@ pan@@ ia .
the officials will also play a role in the surpris@@ ing victory of last November .
the President 's specific country , T@@ y C@@ ob@@ b , said that he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using a new ju@@ ry .
with a ju@@ ry of 10 ju@@ rors , S@@ pea@@ king is usually secret to S@@ ku@@ ll , C@@ ob@@ b last night .
the White House ( White House ) anything that rus@@ hed to finish his work at last .
the White House is fully committed to working with Mu@@ el@@ ler on behalf of Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ r .
the former Director of the F@@ B@@ I , J@@ im Com@@ e@@ y , has said three times that the President is not under investigation , and we have no reason to believe that things have changed .
last week I checked , the bank in Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Ban@@ k on extensive money la@@ under@@ ing .
on Thursday , the government charged against the country 's largest loan to the Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Bank on a broad scale of rules against money la@@ under@@ ing and terrorist financing .
the financial agency , A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C , dis@@ closed that they were at the meeting against Com@@ m@@ Bank because of the serious and systematic lack of conformity of civil proceedings against Com@@ m@@ Bank in the largest case of M@@ ali@@ bu de de la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
the behaviour of Ms Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k in this matter has left society un@@ protected against serious and lasting financial crime , as stated in the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C judgment document .
the Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Ban@@ k said that they were going to look closer and respond , when the time was right .
the largest loan time against I@@ K did not allow me to know at the right time or at all about the suspic@@ ious circumstances of last last last week , with regard to last last night 's time involving more than 77 million dollars ( USD 61 million ) , A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C announced .
according to the Agency , the bank has committed 53 700 acts against money la@@ under@@ ing and terrorist financing , particularly in relation to ' intelligent in@@ puts ' .

♪ Two powerful women ♪ ♪ To keep your success ♪
what does Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an and La@@ il@@ a Ali have in common ?
these women come from two completely different kinds of T@@ EA .
the New York real estate am@@ na@@ te , Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , to conver@@ t a $ 1 000 loan into a five-@@ billion firm before implementing its expertise on the television screen by participating in the A@@ B@@ C re@@ al@@ m series and last last night Shar@@ k Tan@@ k in the setting of S@@ wa@@ b .
La@@ il@@ a Ali has been following his father 's foot@@ steps to become the four-@@ time in@@ v@@ inci@@ ble champi@@ on of the most successful female bo@@ xing before adding to his r@@ é@@ sum@@ é the ro@@ les of television show leader , author and speaker .
however , in spite of their life-@@ style lines ( or perhaps because of them ) , T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x was recru@@ ited by both women in order to talk to the rich entreprene@@ urs at the time about breaking the boxes and achieving the ambitious targets .
last year , T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x for hundreds of women in sh@@ ops across the country and discovered that 80 % of them felt that society had set up defini@@ te ro@@ les and TES@@ S for them .
as a result , they came up with T@@ he Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject to help women break these barriers .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ on and Ali know a lot about it , and they may be our department now , but the journey there wasn 't even smooth for either of them .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an was pri@@ med for D@@ s in high school and last night 's ges@@ ture and had already worked on 20@@ 8@@ s by the age of 22 .
Ali entered one of the most man@@ -@@ cen@@ t@@ red areas and , in addition , he stood on his way to the appearance of the shadow of his father , who was an over@@ ly ic@@ on .
these two , to put it sof@@ tly , f@@ l@@ our@@ ish through the test you 've gained on last last night .
that is why we sat down with these influ@@ ential women to talk about crossing the interpre@@ ters , about success at the A@@ chil@@ les , about confidence in business and in relations .
what would happen to you to do what you do every day ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : me my personal goals on Da@@ ys .
I 've made a ha@@ bit of writing down things I want to achieve .
and I 'll look at that list .
I have to go home . I have to go home .
of course , J@@ ell@@ -@@ O my children .
my ambition to Th@@ row me .
I wish I could be a victory for what I do in my life .
I understand that achieving my goals requires hard work , but I am ready to do so .
my confidence is the result of preparation .
I am therefore spending time on preparations from Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ i .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : like La@@ il@@ ka , the key to my self-@@ confidence is too much preparation , but I will not in@@ sp@@ ire her inspi@@ ration from it .
actually , I 'm inspi@@ red by the je@@ w@@ el cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what happens if I do it ?
what happens if I don 't ?
this cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity is making me rise from the pot in the morning because I can 't wait to see what the day brings .
if I don 't know a se@@ dam@@ ood in a few days , I 'll just do it for the hours .
then I 'll believe in myself and get inspi@@ red again by sa@@ j@@ i .
talk about J@@ ell@@ -@@ O in your career , which made you much better in the long term .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the har@@ dest thing for me was when my business partner , I@@ m , left me and married my secre@@ tary .
I ended up in business a year later , but this year of my life - to be a bike - was terrible because I didn 't have enough confidence to leave .
I felt def@@ ea@@ ted , without any inspi@@ ration .
but amazing things happen .
it 's the har@@ dest thing to believe in in these moments when you 're caught by the J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
a year of timing and re@@ starting business from scra@@ tch , this time without a partner , was extremely difficult .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I would say that my career was the har@@ dest time when I was fighting , I was in my career , and I decided to give in my divorce .
I didn 't just divorce my husband , but I also divor@@ ced the then manager and the person who taught me everything I know about bo@@ xing .
I didn 't think I could make it without him .
so I started to worry about the future of my career and I had to find a time to take a step back and say to myself : you have all the knowledge and experience that you need .
you have all these experiences in the ring .
you can definitely do this to S@@ ku@@ ll .
so I set up a new team around me and continued my career .
in fact , it was just necessary to achieve the right state of mind , because all the rest of them got from there .
I did what I had to do , I had to face fear , and find the encoura@@ gement of my husband and manager , and to continue with my old man , my friend , and all kind .
when did you feel that you were really making progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I felt that I was successful when I won my first Me@@ dia Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship .
it was a really good feeling , because starting with bo@@ xing to be one of the 8 : 00 , to be in@@ v@@ inci@@ ble .
I was able to achieve this goal , and I did not win the Me@@ dal Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship on one occasion , but on four occasions .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the moment I felt that I had made progress was my ele@@ ven@@ th year .
I had finally made a profit .
I had ear@@ ned a profit of about $ 4@@ 2@@ ,000 , which I couldn 't expect .
I went out and bought a new car for both Mom and Dad , and they never had a new car , and I told them to take them to F@@ l@@ ors , where they were in their retirement age .
I felt like an old queen .
I felt so loose .
I did a lot more than I did in the years ' til ' em , but nothing has so far been able to offer the same fe@@ ar@@ ful feeling as the opportunity to give back something from my boy , and to stri@@ p them with surprise .
how did you manage to keep yourself excreted during this 11-@@ year period in order to carry on with OL@@ D ?
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I never measured my business on a profit basis because it was not my purpose .
just to see how far I can get .
I set myself a dream for the first day to become the Queen of New York .
and I saw myself as a st@@ y@@ lis@@ h shot , all of them kis@@ sing my sister and cree@@ ping at me .
there was such a small thought in my head .
so , when I kept trying every day , every hour , I didn 't really mean making money .
in the end , I serve without experience of money .
but all the money that came in , I headed back to business .
I don 't even think I had a day like 8 : 00 , where I would have thought , " Oh , God , we 're not making money . "
I was just convinced something was going to work .
the worst thing that could have happened would have been to lose the company and become a donor again .
I used to make a good yo@@ ga money , and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
therefore , I do not believe that there is money for the great as@@ pi@@ ration of many people who have succeeded .
they have other mo@@ tives that are loy@@ al to them .
and the money wasn 't one of mine .
do you have any advice for someone with such great dreams , but who is being held back by a financial factor ?
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : when I started to make a lot of money , I had money to invest in real estate , but I didn 't have time .
R@@ aja@@ sin u@@ e@@ b .
and that is why I found myself five different partners who were not even S@@ me@@ ll in the bro@@ ker business , but in different neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds all over the city who knew their streets through and through .
I was close to them and I said , " You know this neighborhood . "
find me the best building .
I 'm gonna give you the money , and you 're gonna be my partner .
at this point , when you have the money , you 're wa@@ ving people to make money with your money .
and if you have talent , you can sell it to someone with money and make money with it .
there are two aspects : An@@ ne and the money .
but if you don 't have both , nothing much will happen .
in the end , I - and my partners too - have been very well together over all these years with the great investors I would never have had if I had the courage to find the people of K@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ i who like to dis@@ su@@ ade .
it is always possible to have money - if you believe that you have talent and feel your part of last last year 's work better than anyone else .
what are the two or three things you do every morning that will help you make progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I don 't know about you , but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overwhel@@ med by being a mother , a busines@@ s@@ woman , a husband ... all the ro@@ les we play as a woman .
I reached a point in my life where I was really supposed to set up a routine for the last time I was alive .
I like to get up and just feel than@@ k@@ ful .
gra@@ titude for the faith , for your health , for your children , for your family .
I often write down at night , which is my goal for the next day , and when I wake up , I 'll look at that list again .
- Me@@ di@@ tating .
sometimes I write a day 's wor@@ m .
I always drink a cup of coffee .
and I always do the first of last few hours in the morning , because if I don 't do it , it 's gonna stay with him .
for me , this is ultimately about priorities .
these are things that are important to me : my spi@@ ral nature , to the universe and to the Y@@ um@@ my , then to the tre@@ en@@ ė , and to my health , Mr J@@ um@@ ala .
because of this , everything else seems simple .
I feel like I can p@@ our in a day 's time with all the things I can do on my way to last last last .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , I 'm priori@@ tising things .
I work through my list of tasks , which is end@@ less and ridiculous .
and I 'm putting it in a place that 's most important .
what are the real priorities ?
I will try to accept the achievement of all these things that I have done .
what are you doing to get yourself into the right state of mind for a big meeting ?
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , I can imagine myself failing .
it 's as weird as it is .
I mean , I@@ ss@@ and , I '@@ m@@ --@@ i '@@ m@@ --@@ i '@@ m@@ --@@ i '@@ m@@ --@@ i '@@ m@@ --@@ i mean , I@@ ss@@ and .
I 'm frea@@ king myself out , and that puts me more at last .
I can imagine anyone with me who wishes me - I am by nature anxi@@ ous because I am one in ten children and we never got enough of our parents ' attention .
I can be very competitive .
and I always come in too thoroughly prepared .
too much preparation will strengthen my confidence .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : it 's amazing how ob@@ scene we are about this .
we are two people with 8 8 , and this shows how different things work for different people .
I like to imagine I 'm a success .
I like to think of the end , which is success .
I can imagine it in my mind , and I can see it actually happening .
I see a ring of bo@@ xing , a struggle , a winner of the belt and a return to the clo@@ th , celebra@@ ting victory with a piece of cake , as I always have .
the same is true for 8 8 .
however , I always prepare myself thoroughly , and this confidence is due precisely to preparation , because there is a fear in the back of my head that I will not be doing well or that I will not say things or do not have the information I need .
this is where the pre@@ p for the game comes from .
but I 'm always entering the final outcome on the sk@@ et@@ ch of Th@@ y@@ um@@ my .
you 're both very much in your career .
how do you pass it on ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am very excited to be part of T@@ .@@ J@@ . X@@ I with Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject , because I feel that this is an opportunity to do good .
a large number of women need to be encouraged , encouraged to get them to their dreams and targets .
all of us have a champi@@ on on .
it is , in fact , about the min@@ d@@ set and the ownership of the necessary tools , about the people around themselves , with the people who have managed to achieve the things that you are trying to achieve .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one thing I think I do very well is to create people .
that is why I was very excited to have to work with Mr Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject .
I will try to ig@@ ni@@ te the fla@@ me of person@@ ality and inspi@@ ration that we see here in the faces of all these people and to advise them on how to move forward .
many people are making a start to their dreams of ~ ~ , but at some point , they are getting lost .
so we 're trying to help them concentrate .
everything we teach you is J@@ ill .
commercial , even as simple as a li@@ ghter call , everything you need to set up a company .
what advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in man@@ -@@ cen@@ t@@ red areas ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am acting in one of the most man@@ -@@ cen@@ t@@ red areas of bo@@ xing .
coming after your father , who was I@@ con@@ or of I@@ con@@ or and the best of all time , was pretty scary .
for me , the core of the matter was actually about finding the talent , the courage , the strength in itself .
I had to believe in myself that I could step into the ring and be successful .
at the time , no one else was touched by M@@ u but me , and there were no restrictions in my path other than those that I had set myself in my head .
if you believe in yourself and find your pas@@ sion , no one can stop you .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the journey between the inspi@@ ration of last year and the way I see it - the journey between the King of New York and the King of last year 's - and the crossing of the final line is leng@@ thy .
and in this phase of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O , which is your career every day , you need a lot of tal@@ ents .
what these tal@@ ents need doesn 't have to do with real estate ama@@ teur activities .
I am sure that , in the area of La@@ il@@ a , it was also necessary to decide what the people are , the manag@@ ers of S@@ wa@@ mp , when to start , when to stop , how much money is available , which can be put in , which is not , if you are prepared to work hard .
these are all subjec@@ tive decisions .
in in ' em little bit , to change them so that these women really feel : 8 : 00 , I now get it .
let me drink in .
here 's my three M@@ ist@@ ress .
when they leave with the three main y@@ a@@ ms to really do things , I go home and laugh in bed tonight .
what 's on your night@@ stand right now ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : too much jun@@ k .
maga@@ z@@ ines , fra@@ me@@ works , little pal@@ ace gel , my day .
probably on the water trees .
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : my night@@ stand has a little green wa@@ ke@@ -up clock , because I tried to break a ha@@ bit every morning to watch the first of last night 's phones .
that 's why I got it .
it was in love .
but it never worked .
and still standing there .
and my phone 's still on my night@@ stand .
what kind of book are you reading now ?
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the eight@@ h , or last time ... of last last last last last time ... ... on the moon ... to win friendship and influence people ...
it keeps me on the right track .
I think it 's still the best book written in this area , no matter what you 're drea@@ ming .
and it can be dealt with in exactly the same way in the past these days .
I like to count it on J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
this will help me get back to the right path .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : in Ő@@ i at school , so I 'm reading the book entitled entitled « N@@ isu@@ -free Di@@ e@@ et » .
it 's about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies .
I 'm very interested in that .
what is your best advice with succes@@ ses and fail@@ ures at last ?
Barbara Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : ™ er@@ ge pes@@ si@@ mis@@ ts .
they 're met by all sor@@ ts of forms .
you need to remove their brain from the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
stay away from the ra@@ in@@ ers .
they 're su@@ cking you all empty .
I feel like I feel like I feel like I 'm th@@ ie@@ ves .
they come at night , drink your wal@@ let and leave .
{ \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } { \ c@@ H@@ 80@@ FF@@ FF } {
they 're pulling good people into the hole with them .
I know perfectly well how to avoid all the people of I-I within a 50 km radi@@ us , because my aim is to be positive and to take everything that I can from life and to give everything I have to offer .
so why would I want a minute on such people ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : there must be ~
we will start with many cor@@ ps of convi@@ ction that we will now take this path .
let 's do this , this and this .
but people don 't follow it long enough .
sometimes they give up just before they get over the last piece .
so I think we need to stay on course .
if you feel pas@@ sion@@ ate about something , if you believe in something , you have to be J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
and you have to do the hard work that success requires .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : there is a lot of work to be done to ensure that we do not have to .
do you know what it takes ?
things from J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
you start something , you finish it .
many are good star@@ ters , but not very good gradu@@ ates .
the Chinese cen@@ sors play the game of the cat and mouse .
according to the experts , the shift that might affect users from 8 to the researchers to the companies suggests that China is increasingly concerned about last year 's concerns .
last but not least , last week , E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , who has written a book I k@@ no@@ w W@@ h@@ o m@@ y Com@@ ra@@ des A@@ re , on earth , Cuba and Russia , said that the Internet is more powerful than ever before .
the restrictions imposed on the Internet are in proportion to the impact of Ms on China .
according to the experts , China 's control is not yet max@@ im@@ ally maintained and , in many cases , the game of cat and mouse continues .
one day after A@@ pp@@ le last week , people started to spread the Chinese Social Affairs way to get access to those tools that were so easy that it could even be a stran@@ ger to technology .
this included the registration of a human house in the territory of another country where V@@ P@@ N cells are still available .
however , the test on Thursday shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the cat .
a number of Chinese service providers said on Thursday in their social media accounts , in the fea@@ thers or in the US that Chinese security officials would test a new way of finding these services at the ' A ' , which are either ho@@ sting or using the contents of Mr S@@ wa@@ b .
when they have been found , TH@@ ES@@ E UNDER@@ TA@@ K@@ ING@@ S say that the service providers would require their customers to put an end to this activity .
when customers last last night , the O@@ I@@ R and the Chinese officials cut off their contact minutes .
the Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the fax qu@@ ery to comment on the matter .
studies suggest that people in China will use the V@@ P@@ N and other types of software to by@@ pass the Great li@@ ghter .
although the bloc@@ ka@@ ges of TV broadcas@@ ts and porno@@ graphy are dis@@ coura@@ ged by many people , they present only a small number of people to the group of Chinese users with ~ ~ web wit@@ ty users .
the Chinese President , X@@ I J@@ in@@ ding , has been responsible for the new elements of control over the years , but he is also a technology and a fea@@ ture of J@@ in@@ ping as critical factors for the Chinese economy .
as the space of 8 has begun to play a more central role in all of what is happening in China , the government 's control levels have evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to find out the extent of the new Ms , as many users and companies are not discussing them open@@ ly , afraid of becoming cri@@ pp@@ led by the Chinese Government .
however , some of the frequent users have said that getting out of the constra@@ ints on mbH is becoming more and more pronounced .
a student in the United States and coming back to China to spend $ 8@@ ,000 of holi@@ days said that his local V@@ P@@ N had been d@@ red@@ ged .
he said that he took this period as a kind of ed@@ itor from the social media , and he left F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k with his message to explain why he 's kind of gone under@@ ground .
a student at the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine of environmental technology in a single university in China said that , without 8 '@@ '@@ '@@ IT@@ A , research has changed by ~ , although universities have found alternative tr@@ un@@ ks so that pu@@ pil@@ s do not always need 8 ' .
according to himself , he has now found a new way to by@@ pass the Great L@@ ight without reve@@ aling what it is .
according to China 's figures , some of the V@@ Ps are still working and China would be able to do a lot more to intensi@@ fy the restrictions .
we believe that , if the government had decided to do this , it would have stopped much more from V@@ P@@ N@@ Da@@ da by now , said V@@ P@@ N@@ Da@@ da , a representative of the J@@ ä@@ i , set up in ' 69 , which will help Chinese users find a working V@@ P@@ N .
as long as the government had sent out more cats , the mouse would have a lot of ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ , spoke by a representative who spoke , because of his group 's work in China .
they probably did not do so because they have to leave some room for people or businesses to breathe .
China 's web@@ -based restrictions are often cyc@@ lic@@ al .
the current Dy@@ es are partly due to the im@@ minent meeting of the People 's Party of China S@@ wa@@ b , namely the 19@@ th address of the last person from last night 's party .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ N was hit before a similar meeting at the time by un@@ foreseen interrup@@ tions .
like economic policy or external affairs , cen@@ sor@@ ship in China is also part of a complex and defici@@ ent diagnosis of last resor@@ t .
according to analy@@ sts , government minis@@ tries feel pres@@ sured to show that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem .
thus , this is definitely not the a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ pse of the V@@ P@@ N@@ s , Paul Tri@@ ol@@ o , the head of the consul@@ tancy company E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia G@@ ro@@ u@@ p , the head of the global technology department .
a more sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated environment for users , with new opportunities and new ones , allowing China simply to turn off certain parts of the V@@ P@@ N better at the time and place chosen by M@@ ika , he said .
the Chinese population will learn to deal with them in old times .
earlier this summer , the Chinese giant , T@@ en@@ c@@ ent Te , began the time during which less than 18 were allowed to play the last of the last eight games of last month , the last of last 12 hours of the last year , by allowing those who are younger than 12 , and two hours of those who are 12 to 18 .
as a result , young people in China have started to use an ancient solution - the documents .
so , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh ,
are you interested in a document called J@@ ä@@ ä@@ r , which shows you are older than 18 ?
- No problem .
contact that che@@ ap@@ ly document last week :
he was hun@@ g up on the attack on the global S@@ wa@@ mp .
and then , especially , he J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
when a bad asset from K@@ ron@@ o in eight was first awarded in the Russian de@@ sp@@ ic@@ able mi@@ tes , the price of $ 7@@ ,000 for doing so was that selling bad assets was a lu@@ cra@@ tive venture .
K@@ ron@@ o@@ st was considered to be a ha@@ cker is@@ to@@ ire that can with@@ hold data , including u@@ ser@@ s and pa@@ ro@@ les , the P@@ IN codes of succ@@ inc@@ ts and personal information that is useful in breaking down security issues .
M@@ o@@ th@@ er@@ bo@@ ard announced on Thursday that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ s was de@@ tained in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ ase mbH after a week of visit to the security con@@ ferences B@@ la@@ ck H@@ at and D@@ ef@@ c@@ on .
he was going to fly back to his home , T@@ hea .
with your pri@@ zed star , last week , last week 's Day Day Day :
some warned that the claims against Hu@@ t@@ triga could damage the relationship between the white ha@@ ckers - the investi@@ g@@ ators who seek wise spo@@ ts for identifying and resolving the problems , rather than the criminal activities or the cha@@ os between the cold vampi@@ res and law enforcement bodies .
others took the view that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ s could have created such a smart asset for an attack .
in ' 80@@ s , he asked in T@@ wit@@ ter , and no one has a K@@ ron@@ os exhi@@ bit , which is a strange request to see when he himself was the author of a bad fortune .
although the details of the connection to the K@@ ron@@ os bad th@@ ief are not clear , the security investi@@ g@@ ators have been looking for vulnerable points in the computer code by sear@@ ching for S@@ wa@@ mp P@@ ants .
in recent years , large techn@@ ic@@ i@@ ans have put out the last deca@@ de de by J@@ ell@@ -@@ O companies to for@@ mal@@ ise the process of infor@@ ming and noti@@ fying the investi@@ g@@ ators of the problems and carrying out their work .
at the D@@ ef@@ con@@ i Conference , at the ga@@ thering of security experts from all sides , there has also been a ten@@ se relationship between law enforcement authorities .
in 2002 , the F@@ B@@ I , for example , was arrested in the L@@ as V@@ eg@@ ase Ho@@ tel by a Russian cry@@ p@@ ting expert after having published a software which , according to the words of L@@ es , could have damaged the safety of certain types of e-@@ books .
E@@ le@@ c@@ tron@@ i@@ c F@@ ron@@ ti@@ er F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ ti@@ on said his concern about the arrest of Hu@@ t@@ j@@ i and will examine the matter further .

it pre@@ pa@@ res him to ignore all the wonderful things that a member has to offer .
Sen@@ ator Mag@@ gi@@ e H@@ isu@@ an , New H@@ amp@@ shire Democra@@ t , remarks at I@@ mp@@ shire and T@@ wit@@ ter said in T@@ wit@@ ter that his member state was no different from the others that were fighting the values of the two opi@@ ates in the Netherlands .
Sen@@ ator Je@@ anne s@@ ha@@ he@@ en , as well as a democra@@ t , agreed .
it is totally unacceptable that the President talks about the N@@ H in this way , he wrote at T@@ wit@@ ter .
this is a complete mis@@ representation of the N@@ H and D@@ EA .
O@@ pi@@ o@@ id@@ is@@ vus - the category containing her@@ ro@@ in and f@@ en@@ tan@@ yl - is the most dead@@ ly category in history of last resor@@ t to last year 's history in America .
J@@ ä@@ ä@@ d@@ oo@@ s killed more people than guns or cars in 1986 - estimated 59 000 people on the basis of data analysed by the New York Tim@@ es - and is now the main cause of death by Americans under the age of 50 .
in ' 8 ' , more than 97 million people in the United States with a prescription for pain si@@ len@@ cers , according to data from the PR@@ S .
it is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that had not been determined by the ar@@ tist .
new H@@ amp@@ shire has been hit hard , and its inhabitants repeatedly raised the problem to the J@@ ell@@ y@@ fish population during the 26@@ th campaign .
in New H@@ amp@@ shire , 6@@ th was estimated to have 4@@ 70 deaths due to overdose compared with 4@@ 39 in 2015 .
in 2012 , they were 16@@ 3 according to New H@@ amp@@ shire and service statistics .
on Thursday , the S@@ un@@ u O@@ pi@@ o@@ id epide@@ mic in us as one of the worst health crises ever faced by a member state .
he said that the government has re@@ doub@@ led the resources available for preventing , treating and reco@@ vering at last .
according to him , the Par@@ ti@@ cipa@@ ting Coun@@ try , I@@ ike , is millions of dollars in prevention for children , in the form of legal protection , in the form of nar@@ co@@ tics trafficking , and in the case of MI , with the aim of making a more accessible nal@@ ox@@ one used for the treatment of the disease of the disease .
D@@ is@@ ne@@ y L@@ ong 's coun@@ sel@@ or and leader Mar@@ t@@ y S@@ kla@@ r died at the age of 83 .
S@@ kla@@ r , who died at his home in the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Hol@@ l@@ y@@ wood Hil@@ ls neighborhood on 27 July , was maintained by company 8 in 2009 , with minimal , ti@@ med precisely to the 54@@ th anniversary of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
last year , he became the only member of the tru@@ p on the Chinese Day of S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i D@@ is@@ ne@@ y à la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
and less than two weeks before he died , he took part in the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y F@@ än@@ ni@@ es ' re@@ union at d@@ 23 , sharing memories of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y reported his death without giving rise to it .
he was 83 years old .
S@@ k@@ lar 's position as a newspa@@ per in T@@ he D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws was temporary , but he returned to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land after the gradu@@ ation of U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . in ' 6 , to work in the ad department .
he soon became W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 's main vari@@ ant in writing materials , bran@@ ches , summer drivers , speeches , gi@@ ants , presen@@ tations and short fil@@ ms , such as a piece of letters that helped the company to obtain approval from W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ l@@ di and E@@ p@@ co@@ ti in F@@ l@@ ors .
he also cooper@@ ated with Walt and his brother Ro@@ y on the annual reports from D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Day .
these were quite a deli@@ cate time for a person who was only close to his 30@@ th birthday and who had only six or seven years since his gradu@@ ation , Mr S@@ kla@@ r wrote in his auto@@ bio@@ graphy , Mr D@@ rea@@ m IT ! do IT : m@@ y H@@ al@@ f@@ -C@@ en@@ tur@@ y C@@ read@@ ing D@@ is@@ ne@@ y S. s Ma@@ gic K@@ ing@@ dom@@ s .
but despite W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y trus@@ ting S@@ k@@ lar in writing , he appointed a Ford pa@@ vi@@ lion at the S@@ k@@ lar Cha@@ mpi@@ on of 19@@ 64 , where D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y designed an example and attra@@ ctions .
S@@ kla@@ r wrote a story for W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y for the Ford pa@@ vi@@ lion attra@@ ction for Ma@@ gic sk@@ y@@ way , where you could see anim@@ at@@ ro@@ onic din@@ osa@@ urs and co@@ op@@ ers , and which was their main fea@@ ture of their main acti@@ vis@@ tic spon@@ sor@@ ship .
it was the beginning of S@@ k@@ lar 's second act in the company .
as an increasingly important member and leader of I@@ mag@@ ine@@ ers , he was increasingly linked to the leg@@ acy of W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , who died at the end of 1966 a piece of time before the opening of W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ l@@ di in 197@@ 1 and the opening of E@@ p@@ co@@ t in 198@@ 2 .
after W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y died as a result of lung cancer at 65 years old , S@@ kla@@ r was sc@@ rap@@ ped back into the world of writing when he was told that the company 's manag@@ ers were not in public direc@@ tors , although it was not a secret that W@@ alt was dying , as he wri@@ tes in his auto@@ bio@@ graphy .
S@@ kla@@ r , he said he felt that he was supposed to write a statement that Ro@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y was signing , but he felt that last night 's diagnosis was a sign that W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 's death had been har@@ med by the company 's leaders .
in reality they were all scared to death , by S@@ kla@@ r .
Martin Adri@@ an S@@ kla@@ r was born in February in New B@@ run@@ s@@ w@@ ick , New Jer@@ sey .
his father Le@@ on was a teacher and a mother , a vir@@ gin named L@@ il@@ y@@ n F@@ u@@ ch@@ s , worked in Joh@@ n@@ son at Joh@@ n@@ son , Joh@@ n@@ son , before his family moved to L@@ on@@ g B@@ each in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , when Mar@@ t@@ y was 12 .
after high school , he had a number of bra@@ in@@ ful jobs , such as D@@ ou@@ g@@ las Air@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , an ic@@ e-@@ cream squ@@ ad@@ ron , H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g@@ eri@@ esia or@@ an dri@@ ve@@ -@@ in ' , and also as a cargo ve@@ ctor of eight .
but in May 5@@ th , when his third year of U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ u@@ s was coming to an end , S@@ kla@@ r received a message that he would spo@@ il the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y S@@ how and Ad@@ ver@@ tising Lea@@ der E@@ . Car@@ d@@ on Walker .
at the time , S@@ kla@@ r U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . student newspa@@ per T@@ he Da@@ il@@ y B@@ ru@@ in was a new ed@@ itor .
Wal@@ ker asked him to come to the newspa@@ per for the creat@@ or of T@@ he D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws and for the ed@@ itor , Guy , to work inter@@ views .
Wal@@ ker said the the@@ me park will be opened soon .
and it needs him .
Wal@@ ker hired him after 20 minutes of inter@@ views .
but S@@ kla@@ r also had to prove to W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ney that he knew what he was doing .
I had been working there for two weeks , and I had to present W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ney with a sheet called " b " , remin@@ ded me of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ u@@ e last last night .
if Walt hadn 't liked it , he 'd have thrown me out the door and hired a professional .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , Walt liked it .
I was 21 .
it was scary .
I had never worked at this level on J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
S@@ kla@@ r was in the form of W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y ( and also some other people ) to learn at one point Ms M@@ iki for ten orders , i.e. the board of the@@ me park man@@ if@@ est .
the orders include , for example , the following .
try to get in the shoes of vis@@ itors to a co@@ yo@@ te like them .
tell me only one story at a time for each attra@@ ction .
the Bo@@ b R@@ ables Ex@@ per@@ t of the C@@ ame@@ l Div@@ or@@ ce called S@@ k@@ lar once called the W@@ iz@@ ard 's app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip ... the role M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ir played in D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 's film in F@@ anta@@ sia last ( 19@@ 40 ) - because he had been sta@@ ring at D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 's F@@ at last last last last last .
the S@@ k@@ lar is left behind by his husband , the vir@@ gin , Le@@ a@@ h Ger@@ ber , the ty@@ rant L@@ es@@ li@@ e S@@ kla@@ r , the son of Ho@@ w@@ ard , and four grand@@ children .
S@@ kla@@ r was D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 's committed leader .
he regularly shi@@ f@@ ted the 3 M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Mo@@ use watch with a target plate ( which showed him the time in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , I@@ ke and T@@ ok@@ yo ) and the gol@@ den cur@@ rant of the M@@ ik@@ i Mo@@ use .
and he never forgot anything W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had taught him .
when D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Compan@@ y fell in love with C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia Ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ e Park , special members of Ms S@@ kla@@ r mbH to add to the activities that parents and children could do together , as W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had de@@ man@@ ded .
I remin@@ ded everyone that D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and existed at all because Walt used to take his dau@@ gh@@ ters with a car@@ ou@@ sel from Di@@ ane '@@ i and Shar@@ on G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith Park , said to T@@ he L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les in 2002 , and Daddy had to sit on the park ben@@ ch and have to eat sna@@ cks and pop@@ cor@@ n by children alone . - I 'm fine .
he thought he had a colleague with a throat .
but why were his sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s such as S@@ TI@@ L@@ L ?
at the Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ Po@@ int , he was given a large d@@ oo@@ s A@@ se@@ ta@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ n .
for the rest of the day , he was ques@@ tioned , sta@@ bbed , sor@@ ted and investigated .
none of the tests showed anything , but they couldn 't send him home .
his cause .
for the last two years , he had taken a medicine called e@@ than@@ er@@ tse@@ p@@ t to treat S@@ j@@ ö@@ gre@@ n ’ s or@@ phan medicine .
the medicine reduces the Im@@ mu@@ no@@ lation System mbH and it pi@@ er@@ ced its ability to fight in@@ fec@@ tions .
S@@ j@@ ö@@ gre@@ n is an au@@ tisti@@ c break@@ through - a rather my@@ steri@@ ous disease in which the body 's own white blood cells attack normal tissue , as if it were an in@@ tru@@ ding organ that so@@ w cha@@ os in this case in both fac@@ ial crea@@ tions , te@@ ars and sp@@ it , as well as in the joints .
each week of e@@ than@@ ol injections were helpful by reducing the pain in the joints .
but he knew that the medication made him quite hel@@ ple@@ ss in the event of a serious incident .
when A@@ se@@ ta@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ n started working , the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er felt a lot better .
the doctors at the Tra@@ u@@ ma Po@@ st decided to leave him at the hospital for the night .
if this is a virus , as the doctors suspected , she 'll be fine the next day , and she 'll be released at home .
when G@@ ir@@ ard first heard his Mi@@ pa@@ ci@@ te , he brought himself up to speed with the in@@ fec@@ tions to which people who de@@ sp@@ ise e@@ than@@ er@@ tse@@ p@@ ti are susceptible .
that list was long .
the virus cannot be treated before the diagnosis , which is why it focused on bacterial infections .
one bacteri@@ um that attacks people with im@@ modification is an additive with food .
it is found in Bi@@ ble milk and hair of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O , causing terrible growth , ob@@ struction and lax@@ ity , which it did not have .
Le@@ e@@ gi@@ on ’ s disease is another infection that has spread among the recipients of this medicine , but has been free of cough or short@@ ness of breath .
a more lev@@ in@@ um bacteri@@ um Sta@@ p@@ h@@ y@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ us au@@ re@@ us may cause joint infections , but , again , he did not have joint infections .
nevertheless , the intention was to initiate a course of antibiotic therapy to cover all these risks .
but when I met the pa@@ ci@@ fic , it didn 't seem like he could be bo@@ thered by a serious incident .
the doctors at the Tra@@ u@@ ma site didn 't give him any antibiotics .
the doctor had the opportunity to man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re antibiotics and simply monitor and wait , but if the P@@ D@@ As were one of the inci@@ dents he had read about , the treatment could have even been fatal for a few hours .
the situation was further altered by the fact that the pa@@ ci@@ ent thought he was allergic to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , although he did not remember what happened when he took it .
it made a difference between risk and benefit .
the decision on whether or not to start antibiotic treatment is usually modified when its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked a colleague , another resident , to assess the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er .
G@@ ir@@ ard didn 't tell me he was planning antibiotic treatment , and he just asked me to review the patient and give you a recommendation .
my colleague had a ple@@ a and agreed .
even though she looked good , she 'd be practically defen@@ se@@ less against it if she had in@@ fec@@ ted .
the ar@@ tist should give you pa@@ ci@@ fic antibiotics .
because pen@@ ic@@ il@@ la@@ -@@ ey@@ el@@ ash i@@ aller@@ gy has been reported , G@@ ir@@ ard should have him tested to check whether he tole@@ rates a drug that is not pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , but a close relative .
G@@ ir@@ ard asked me to man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re the test .
if she had a serious reaction to the medication , she would have had a rash or a reduction in her blood pressure .
neither did it .
that 's why he was de@@ man@@ ded in the whole dra@@ ma .
a few hours later , G@@ ir@@ ard got a call .
the patient 's temperature had ri@@ sen to 39 degrees .
he rus@@ hed to see the pa@@ ci@@ ent .
the patient 's face was sh@@ run@@ k from thin swe@@ at , and his che@@ eks were pink .
although she seemed un@@ comfortable , her heart and blood pressure were fine .
the ar@@ st was lucky to hear that he had given the pa@@ ci@@ fic antibiotics .
he asked for another drink to T@@ y@@ len@@ ol , and when he came to see the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er one last time , he slept deeply .
the pra@@ yer had sa@@ bo@@ red .
H@@ ig@@ ine 's gu@@ m and pink che@@ eks were gone .
the next night , when G@@ ir@@ ard N@@ ight sw@@ ap@@ ped into hospital skin , trig@@ gered that pa@@ ci@@ fic .
he had also received five other pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ ers , but this patient was most concerned about G@@ ir@@ ard at home after he was handed over to last day 's age .
during the days he didn 't see him , the lab was raised by an organ@@ ism in his blood .
it was too early to tell you what it was .
it was clear , however , that this is a bacteri@@ um that is enough to allow Pet@@ r to agree quickly and that it is not Sta@@ p@@ h@@ y@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ us au@@ re@@ us or Le@@ gi@@ on@@ na@@ ire .
the list of other options was long , and none of them actually saw fit .
it took two more days before they could finally identify the bacteri@@ um .
it was an additional ac@@ tor .
G@@ ir@@ ard , like everyone else who took care of the patient , was surprised .
as an ar@@ tist , you get pictures of diseases in your head .
for G@@ ir@@ ard , lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis was a disease produced by pas@@ t@@ ö@@ ri@@ se@@ ous milk and soft hair that causes growth , vomiting and diarrhoea .
he worked through further material about this unusual incident and found that , although people with normal im@@ modification systems may experience these symptoms quickly , they usually recover quickly , as a colleague of a patient .
however , in the case of pregnant women , older people , who are 65 years of age and who have a damaged immune system , the in@@ fec@@ tion may be released outside the di@@ ges@@ tive tract , sometimes without the appearance of normal symptoms , and enter the bloo@@ d@@ stream .
from there , it could spread all over the body like a wil@@ d@@ fire .
this type of inc@@ u@@ bation , called in@@ va@@ ila@@ ble lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis , may be fatal in patients suffering from it , up to 30 % of the cases .
indeed , although it is not as common as bo@@ tu@@ lis@@ m , lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis can be as leth@@ al .
early antibiotic treatment can save life .
if this is a food transmitted disease , what food does carry this bacteri@@ um ?
although the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er and his colleague were not on a trip with pas@@ t@@ ö@@ ri@@ se@@ ous milk or soft hair called " I@@ ce " was identified this summer by a search for an additional outbreak related to b@@ len@@ ded beef .
neither of them had ea@@ ten succ@@ inc@@ t beef , but they ate a little bit of sou@@ ven@@ ir .
the one where they picked up the bacteria was a my@@ ster@@ y .
when the team of doctors had found out what was wrong with the pa@@ ja@@ mas , they were able to adjust the antibiotics .
her tri@@ -@@ week treatment ended in L@@ IA .
the doctors have suggested that he take it easy until the end , but by now , he feels quite well and has returned to the mu@@ se@@ um and to his char@@ med work .
you can 't find P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ s .
seven@@ ty years after the history of the two countries that began with the separation of the two countries , the resul@@ tant population migration continues to flow from the Hin@@ du to India .
thousands of people who do not even have the right to work - are already waiting for them at the border of two countries .
therefore , many have no choice but to s@@ mas@@ h permanently close to temporary habi@@ ta@@ ts by bur@@ ying fi@@ bre@@ -@@ ro@@ cks - Indian mbH on the other side of the border with a very sharp amount of movements .
most of the people who arrived at I@@ so@@ l can 't expect such a reception .
no work , no house , no money , no gu@@ ilt .
we worked there in the fields , we were pe@@ as@@ ants .
here , however , the likes of us , I@@ ts themselves serve to dis@@ man@@ tle the ro@@ cks in the word " J@@ 8 " .
it is not for us to get through .
the prices are still trying to reach their own country , Ő@@ u .
and when they come here , they have nothing at all , an elderly man added Jo@@ d@@ h@@ pur@@ i to a field camp near the city .
more than 15 million people lost their homes after the independence of India under British AD in ' 7 .
the se@@ cession was caused by a wave of violence in six months , which lost at least one million people because of religious hat@@ red .
in the mid@@ st of the bloody cha@@ os , the prices and the S@@ ik@@ hs from the new@@ ly-@@ formed S@@ ik@@ hs of J@@ ä@@ ä@@ i , but the Le@@ f@@ s were moving in the direction of the F@@ ami@@ ly .
despite the number of minority groups in Pakistan , prices have still been estimated .
according to different estimates , they account for around 1.@@ 6 % of the country 's 200@@ -@@ million thousand .
many of them compla@@ in about M@@ é@@ sa@@ n de la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
two days after the separation started in S@@ wa@@ b , the J@@ u@@ e@@ das , whose family moved only a few months before the two countries ' escape from last last last last last last year to last last last last last year .
not a day has passed when we could have lived at least last .
I wanted to come back to live among my rat@@ ings .
the national government of the N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra mo@@ d of India has said that it wants to make things easier for religious reasons on last last night on last last night .
last year , the government started to make it possible for Mr Ő@@ ran@@ ts to apply for their place of residence , earlier through the central government for all things .
the Hin@@ dus around 2 l@@ b to India , after seven years of life in the country , opens up a chance to get quick drinks in the country .
however , due to the delay of 8 ° C , this process is often much more time-@@ consum@@ ing .
a 6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i dis@@ sol@@ ved from S@@ wa@@ mp in 1997 and became India in 2005 .
however , he says that many people are back to Pakistan because they see that they are not expected to have a good life .
the government won 't give any support .
we 're like cattle animals without the owner .
we 're just trying to survive on our own , the word " K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i . "
but J@@ ä@@ ä@@ i 's even worse is the scep@@ tic@@ ism of J@@ ä@@ ä@@ i .
those who do not have a nationality are considered to be gree@@ dy by the execu@@ tives of last week .
they were always suspe@@ cts and Pakistani agents , he explained .
S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ al , who laid the foundation for the ch@@ ari@@ table organisation dedicated to Jo@@ d@@ h@@ pur@@ is K@@ ä@@ ä@@ i , was great with regard to the mo@@ de that came from D@@ ä@@ ä@@ i in last year , but he has now had to be disappointed .
the Mo@@ di government has grown between India and Pakistan , and it is causing the greatest suffering from S@@ D@@ R .
~ The@@ ir life becomes hell ~ ~ , the word So@@ d@@ h@@ al .
for many , however , this treatment is better than life 's .
Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i f@@ led to India with two ful@@ l-@@ grown sons two years ago because he had begun to receive murder threats from his P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ is neighbours .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) We had to fle@@ e to India , S@@ aid 6@@ 5-@@ year-old Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i , whose grand@@ parents were from the current Indian territories , but found themselves on the wrong side of the border by cle@@ aring the country .
my grandfather moved on the other side because of his work .
but he told us that we would move to India at the right moment , because at the time of the day , in A@@ va , the future could become dangerous to the prices .
on Monday , the last chance was to offer a nice name for a w@@ ood@@ chu@@ ck born at the beginning of June .
Lo@@ oma@@ a@@ ed@@ n@@ ė is now a big box of T@@ ase@@ s to re@@ vise to find the right thing to find on the birthday of the animal garden , 25@@ th de sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly out .
but you can still give a name to the pu@@ ps until the day of re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
from the very beginning of 8 : 00 , the whole w@@ ine-@@ growing family sees him walking in the bo@@ ar at the same time .
and even though Father K@@ ig@@ oma is running around and stu@@ ff@@ ing in the gar@@ den@@ s with the hor@@ n , Mom Ki@@ bi@@ bi won 't let herself get distra@@ cted , and the w@@ ick 's w@@ ood@@ chu@@ ck gets a good lesson .
even though the birth o@@ ven is over , you will see the 1st World L@@ ight of Y@@ el@@ low and two ho@@ gs for him .
on M@@ oun@@ t K@@ ul@@ l , do@@ z@@ ens of sa@@ us@@ ages can get caught on Day 6@@ s .
in children of Ta@@ ki@@ in@@ ė , which looks like her own , the time of running began .
Thursday , another Vi@@ va@@ c@@ ol@@ or col@@ or@@ ing day took place in the z@@ oo .
a large number of good assis@@ tants pain@@ ted the new camera house , the garden pos@@ ters of the female e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts and the view of the male e@@ leph@@ ant .
in order not to inter@@ rupt the pain@@ ters , the mother@@ fuck@@ ers were once again spent with F@@ i@@ en and D@@ ra@@ a@@ y , the Father E@@ leph@@ ant Car@@ li .
on Monday 9@@ th , on the second classi@@ c Wednesday of E@@ pis@@ o@@ de A@@ a@@ vo , there is a tro@@ m@@ pe@@ i@@ an@@ sam@@ bel on the top of A@@ a@@ vo .
the lo@@ oma garden will be com@@ memor@@ ated by the in@@ bred K@@ ru@@ us and other fine hon@@ ors .
the procee@@ ds of the sale of ha@@ ke go to support for the relevant super@@ ficial project .
over EUR 1 000 was collected for ch@@ ari@@ table sales last week on T@@ ig@@ er Day .
Y@@ our@@ ri Kol@@ k , spend a whole year , so you don 't need a rest .
of course , I was myself guilty of remaining on that le@@ f@@ to@@ ver .
I was also a somewhat needed employee of the village , but I think it was the only one who thought I was a substitu@@ te guy .
it was to blame for the la@@ me feeling of duty in my chest .
the ci@@ ta@@ te presented at the beginning of last last night is a good thing because it is absolutely true .
so there was a new agency , which I started in March of the same year , which required my share of the I@@ Q , but something in this job was so much better for me that I recovered in three months to a whole new life , I res@@ ted out .
it 's summer , time for holi@@ days .
it 's time to give the New Year 's , look at what 's happened in life , and the direction this whole thing is going .
last but not least , there is a time of year and a time of year for this , and now some decent citizens are trying to get mad .
well , maybe it is , but we all know , in our last few days , that the last thing we can do is to think about life and set targets .
all right , all I 'm talking about is myself . I can 't do any of them at the end of the year .
it 's too hard for me .
of course , in the Christmas era there is happ@@ iness and joy : I like to know the beginning of a protein race , like Christmas lights , and Jesus was also very much with a sy@@ mme@@ tri@@ cal attitude , a revolu@@ tionary min@@ ia@@ ture self .
despite this , I am mostly very ti@@ ring at Christmas , and sometimes I am also very stressed - because of this g@@ lit@@ ch .
Yeah , I 'm doing a lot of work living a se@@ den@@ -free life , maybe a lot of work , maybe a little bit of work , if I were doing some kind of Ku@@ dos at the time of the killing , and I 've been res@@ ting all the time .
most of the time before Christmas , I 've been running like a squ@@ ir@@ rel bike - gi@@ fts , at least four Christmas parties , a little bigger at work ...
the difficulties of Christmas time are obvious , also taking into account the social pressure of La@@ kes to feel joy and peace in the heart .
but a desperate and tired person is unable to make good decisions , not at last .
such things still have to be done with the clear head of Mr J@@ ä@@ ä@@ i .
a fu@@ c@@ ke@@ d-up person might be throwing air empty and bo@@ ils out of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O , which will help us ruin the future spirit itself about as much as buying a lo@@ t@@ tery ticket .
a plan should be considered cal@@ mly , which is intended to change something , which should benefit the aus@@ teri@@ ty , it should be a plan .
the plan , in contrast to the promise , includes not only the purpose , but also the code of conduct , but it does not go over a couple of pe@@ p@@ pers , because of the pla@@ gue .
that is why I am saying that the best time to ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t S@@ wa@@ b is now , in the summer .
you just have to get out easy and wonder why this fatigue is as big as it is .
if you do not obli@@ ge yourself to get out of the bar@@ n like a wh@@ im@@ per during the rest of your vacation , then a few weeks will su@@ ffice to find a hook in your life that deserves a si@@ r@@ ge@@ e of tw@@ is@@ ting and to figure out how exactly this can be done .
I think it 's important to live as much as possible so I don 't need to rest on a running basis , not once a year .
so there would be an additional au@@ ction , not a bo@@ xing stop for survival , during which you are now being charged with so much as to be able to survive next year .
I would suggest at least one summer to everyone - if you have to get up next morning at last night , you will have to sleep well .
I believe that if any of the read@@ ers of the S@@ ho@@ t@@ shot Man listened to my recommendation , life in Estonia would be significantly better .
I 'm going to follow my own advice .
these kinds of experiments are attra@@ cted to people .
it would be very good if we were to think further and to draw conclusions .
the recommendation would take a little more time to examine the background of the willing .
there could be a kind of strategy , however , which he shares about himself by the social acti@@ vis@@ ts .
at national level , however , the question must be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats against social affairs .
the sli@@ p@@ pers created under controlled conditions ended at home with the school , but the na@@ tive gre@@ ens certainly did not .
the fourth Est@@ onian person was born into the heart .
according to doctors from the nor@@ thern Re@@ gi@@ onal H@@ os@@ pi@@ tal ( P@@ ER@@ H ) in Northern Estonia , with Fin@@ nish medic@@ s involved in the surgery , the Car@@ di@@ o@@ kir@@ ur@@ gi « ter T@@ ali » and the Car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist P@@ en@@ tti K@@ id@@ ra , the period after the operation has prog@@ ressed as expected .
it is very difficult to say how long the pa@@ ci@@ ent would have been able to live with the new ZY@@ P@@ AD@@ H@@ ERA , spoke of the C@@ ross .
according to doctors , the world has now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years .
he 's still reco@@ vering , and he 's not ready to talk about it .
he was diagnosed with heart failure for the first time two years ago , and the disease had already reached the final stage , and heart failure was caused by an is@@ che@@ mic disease .
for this disease , the transplant was the only option left left at last , in Ta@@ al .
according to the Car@@ di@@ o@@ kir@@ ur@@ g , after the transplant , pig@@ e@@ ons no longer have any bat@@ teri@@ es or clu@@ es with the heart pump .
all he 's got is s@@ cars and in@@ contin@@ ence pills .
a pa@@ ci@@ fic can carry on sports and generally lives like a normal person called Jos@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ sum@@ é .
the first year is the most dangerous .
the b@@ lun@@ t has added that the recovery will take three to six months .
according to both ar@@ tis@@ ts , the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er must be kept strictly under regular monitoring of the intake of medication ; however , medicinal products also have side effects .
in addition , the pa@@ ci@@ fi@@ er must be controlled to prevent organ rejection .
the most dangerous is the first year , but according to IS@@ H@@ L@@ T , the International So@@ ci@@ ety for H@@ e@@ ar@@ t and L@@ un@@ g T@@ um@@ b , 50 % of the pa@@ ci@@ ents are already living for more than 10 years .
Thailand stated that the results were better in Hel@@ sin@@ ki and that the lon@@ gest lived was graft or 25 years .
Kar@@ di@@ o@@ kir@@ ur@@ g Dy@@ es that , because of the disease , the patient 's blood flow was poor , a heart pump was put on him a year ago , which helped to heal for the operation .
when a man fell on his pulmonary artery , he became a suitable transplant for last night .
the transplant operation is not considered to be very much in the opinion of T@@ ali : the timing is very important .
it took a lot more time to get the pump , and then get the coal when the new coal came in by last night , he said .
in addition , as part of the complex part of the operation , the Car@@ di@@ o@@ ch@@ ur@@ g brought out the ex@@ teri@@ or bloo@@ d@@ stream .
rather , according to him , the tab@@ ling of J@@ ill could be considered to be repeated , as it is the least that the Est@@ oni@@ ans need .
two hundred and twen@@ ty-@@ nine more trans@@ plants are made of kidney , liver and lung trans@@ plants .
I mean , it 's all about the goo@@ dy surgery that comes with ex@@ ci@@ tement , but we 've been practic@@ ing this job for years .
to get to know myself and your nervous system , one art at this office is called " J@@ el@@ ly , " in Ta@@ al .
there are four more people in need of this body .
T@@ ali claimed that sa@@ adi pa@@ ci@@ fy b@@ lun@@ t because none of the other patients in the countries of S@@ c@@ an@@ dia pl@@ andi b b .
S@@ c@@ an@@ di@@ at@@ tet pl@@ ant is an organisation for the exchange of organs , of which Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia are members .
there are currently four other people on the heart of the transplant list in Estonia .
these are still the coun@@ ted patients L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise , emphasised by the P@@ õ@@ der .
for the lon@@ gest time , according to T@@ ali , large men with a zero positive blood type are waiting for the heart .

there 's a lot of conditions to get to the heart .
last night 's Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day Day will not usually fit for a woman 's heart to a small human heart , and so on to the spell of a Car@@ di@@ o@@ ch@@ ur@@ g .
there is no need for a good out@@ line line to be sear@@ ched - 7@@ th to 12 h@@ oles in the down@@ town of Tar@@ tu , on the square of the city hall , the film f@@ esti@@ val of the T@@ AR@@ Tu@@ F@@ F .
that makes it special for the love movies of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
the program also contains fil@@ ms that represent a nu@@ mb of love , seeing new fla@@ t@@ works as well as good old classi@@ cs .
the special events in many I@@ des make a movie town from a university for a week .
all the frea@@ ks are free for vis@@ itors , there are up to 1,@@ 500 places , and this year there will be an artificial la@@ cer@@ ated area on the screen , which will temporarily create a park mind for the centre of the city .
Europe 's largest foreign town town in Switzerland is now getting 8 000 vis@@ itors at the same time .
Lo@@ c@@ ar@@ no fil@@ mi@@ f@@ esti@@ val ex last night at the central square of two to 12 h@@ oles in Pi@@ az@@ za G@@ ran@@ de or Grand Squ@@ are .
in the context of the f@@ esti@@ val , there are many fore@@ ig@@ ners , cha@@ ired by recognised direc@@ tors and participants .
when the darkness of the evening arri@@ ves , a ticket of EUR 15 to 20 will have to be re@@ deemed for the benefit of one film .

the G@@ la@@ di@@ ators , the ver@@ i , the sh@@ ou@@ ting crow@@ ds , the mu@@ dane aren@@ a - this image opened in a P@@ ul@@ a amp@@ hi@@ at@@ re in Croatia 2 000 years ago , where it is now enjo@@ ying international fil@@ ms in the night of July S@@ wa@@ mp .
for the first time , the field screen was set up in Ro@@ oma@@ -@@ era I@@ ts in ' 3 , which makes the P@@ ul@@ a film f@@ esti@@ val one of the ol@@ dest out@@ doors in Europe .
there are good fil@@ ms bene@@ ath the rat@@ ings of Richard Bur@@ ton and E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ta@@ y@@ l@@ or , John Mal@@ ko@@ vi@@ ch and Ben K@@ ing@@ s@@ ley .
the price is two thousand : the evening in the C@@ ho@@ ice of the Mediterranean with the movies means about three y@@ u@@ ps .

indeed , it operates in the high Mon@@ t@@ ju@@ ï@@ c , the Je@@ wish M@@ oun@@ tain , above Barcelona .
in the mid@@ st of the success of southern Europe , the entire Barcelona F@@ ire M@@ oun@@ tain of a for@@ tress on the mountain seems to be the wat@@ ch@@ mak@@ er of the for@@ tress , which is the values on its own .
Val@@ lik@@ ra@@ a@@ vi 's s@@ op@@ p will be erec@@ ted by July to a large screen with famous fil@@ ms from 8 to 9 to 9 to Man@@ hat@@ tan .

apart from the classi@@ c mus@@ ic@@ i@@ ans - the P@@ la@@ ci@@ do D@@ om@@ ing@@ o and the Vi@@ ini F@@ il@@ 8 concer@@ ts - the f@@ esti@@ val offers ju@@ ic@@ y rec@@ ord@@ ings .

comparison of the most fashi@@ on@@ able s@@ pac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft : from the N@@ ight C@@ lu@@ b ( N@@ ight C@@ lu@@ b ) test to the sa@@ un@@ ari@@ ans
the consumer performance of the po@@ stal man compared the favourable packages of S@@ pa@@ ade lu to one person for one night from 11 to 12 .
Ms S@@ pa@@ a@@ ho@@ tel@@ ls are of a different level and with a different choice , so one comparison to one on the basis of price alone is very difficult to do , and O@@ U S@@ pa T@@ our@@ s 's sal@@ es@@ man spoke to Ms Sa@@ u .
in comparison to the dis@@ advantages of S@@ pa@@ -@@ Te , it has emer@@ ged that the prices of the most advan@@ ta@@ geous T@@ ase@@ s vary several times and that Ms can be found with both more demanding customers and more modest desi@@ res for holi@@ days .
for example , when a passenger alone receives 51 euro worth of time in a one-@@ si@@ ded room of V@@ är@@ ska S@@ pa at a water centre house in bu@@ ff@@ et@@ -@@ evening and aer@@ os@@ pace and water park , gy@@ m and sa@@ un@@ as j@@ ä@@ i j@@ i j@@ i , one person will be charged a package of EUR 2@@ 87 by vis@@ iting a fellow Mu@@ hu@@ land .
it includes a room in category I of D@@ ou@@ b@@ le D@@ elu@@ x@@ e b , a sna@@ ke@@ -@@ eating squ@@ ir@@ rel in Alexander 's winter garden , and a cho@@ ir and a wet , half-@@ day s@@ pac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft .
when sele@@ cting and comparing different packages , it should be taken into account that , in order to obtain the most favourable price , leave should be taken on holiday with a compan@@ ion or two rooms of night , because it will be more advan@@ ta@@ geous than the adoption of a room called eight .
however , if there is a desire to blow alone , the vis@@ itor will be offered , as appropriate , both special one-@@ man rooms and two-@@ dig@@ it rooms for the extra fee .
while , in general , un@@ compan@@ ied passengers will have to be paid just a couple of decades of e@@ ur@@ one supplement alone for two atten@@ dance room eight eight , it will be possible to find favourable options as well .
for example , F@@ R@@ A M@@ are T@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ as , in Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us , the package costs EUR 86 per night in a one-@@ si@@ ded room , but it also offers a favourable opportunity to stay in a two-@@ dig@@ it room , provided that , in the event of a shor@@ tage of space , someone else will be put aside by the usual clients .
in this case , the package will be estimated at EUR 58 .
to get the most advan@@ ta@@ geous deal , it 's worth being T@@ hea .
in other words , the prices of 8 ° C will depend on the day and improvement of the week .
with the most advan@@ ta@@ geous package , prices can vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 , to the S@@ G & A of the V S@@ pa@@ a@@ Ho@@ tel in Tar@@ tus , in Tri@@ in@@ u , their pri@@ cing policy .
his attention was also drawn to the fact that in their hotel@@ s the price is variable , depending on the improvement , and added that , as a general rule , the customer receives the most advan@@ ta@@ geous price , directly to their website or by asking for their offer .
since the summer period is the fas@@ test for s@@ pac@@ ers , it is wor@@ th@@ while to rest in good time in order to avoid a situation in which the desired place has been sold out .
for example , 11 7@@ 68 have been chosen for the time of comparison between the L@@ ight S@@ pa and S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa and last but a few s@@ vi@@ des in the Ho@@ tel on S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa , and S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa , as well as the Vi@@ hul@@ a Man@@ or on La@@ he@@ land , have been sold out .
there is no need to look for a break in the rest : almost every major Est@@ onian town will be found with one or more S@@ pa@@ ts .
it is worth examining before purch@@ asing the package and , at the same time , there will be no major event in the clo@@ sen@@ ess , because it will immediately raise prices .
for example , until the 11@@ th and 13@@ th h@@ oles , the events of the White D@@ am are taking place in Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us .
at that time , the Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us is a lot of tur@@ keys , a lot of J@@ ell@@ -@@ O places , and we have the price of major events at that time .
thus , at that time , we have no preferential sale or advan@@ ta@@ geous pac@@ kets at 8 ° C , commen@@ ting on S@@ pa@@ a@@ ho@@ tel@@ li Man@@ ager I@@ ren@@ e 's field .

I have , of course , heard of the l@@ ings of the S@@ ighs ships .
who wouldn 't ?
after all , the Tibet go several times a day between T@@ all@@ in@@ na and Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
it 's no big deal .
the Swiss company S@@ up@@ ň ar introduced the first last last last last of the pho@@ ili@@ an boat , the F@@ rec@@ ci@@ a d mbH on the market in ' Or@@ o ' or ' K@@ ul@@ d@@ se arro@@ ws ' in ' 2 .

Ka@@ ta@@ mar@@ a@@ an , but still sa@@ iling .
what kind of power is it supposed to get in the air ?
let us , however , keep ourselves open ( it is not difficult to find ) and straight to the concept of pho@@ ili@@ ation at the concept of « farm boy » , « farm boy » , « pe@@ asant » .
why do plan@@ es stay in the air ?
the shape of the wing is that , if the plane goes ahead at high speed , the air under the wing and above due to the difference between the pressure at the level of the different Jos@@ é@@ vi@@ va creates a s@@ nee@@ ze of lif@@ ting power , at one point it cro@@ sses the plane 's machine , and lif@@ ts up the whole machine .
in essen@@ ce , the same process also takes place in the water .
with the right shape , the wing gener@@ ates lif@@ ting power at a high speed , and this , in turn , raises the base of Mr Ő@@ u out of the water .
easy , isn 't it ?
things go to numbers when we get to the numbers .
the air@@ plane needs an air take@@ -@@ off between 150 and 250 miles an hour , with sa@@ ils running a world record at present only 7@@ 1.1 km / h .
however , let us not get bo@@ gged down in high school physi@@ cs .
today I have come to look at the l@@ ings of Ka@@ mar@@ an , known as ' the C@@ R@@ A@@ F@@ 20 Car@@ bon F@@ CS ' .
the C@@ R@@ A comes together from the premi@@ ere letters of the last deca@@ de Nor@@ th@@ -A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an Ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an R@@ ating As@@ so@@ ci@@ a@@ thi@@ on .
the F@@ CS is a chan@@ deli@@ er from the F@@ light Con@@ tro@@ l S@@ y@@ ste@@ m M@@ ess .
it is a system that allows T@@ hea to set the foundations even in the middle of the middle of Saint D@@ é@@ n@@ da de la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
as soon as the Cata@@ mar@@ an is released from the roof , it is clear that this is not a gentleman 's Than@@ ks@@ giving sa@@ il .

I ask when I point out the sa@@ il .
Yeah , it 's all carbon fi@@ ber .
I don 't get it .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
170 kil@@ os - the three of us going abo@@ ard - would certainly amount to more than 170 kil@@ os .
I 'm comparing everything from pes@@ u@@ se@@ bis to even@@ ings with cars , and there 's no way around it - the last C@@ R@@ A f@@ 20 is like a street ride to the last lap weapon on last night .

there is a feeling that in L@@ ah@@ ings , a ha@@ p@@ ni@@ ku@@ bal@@ lo@@ on as well as the sea , could go to Mar@@ s@@ si ’ s I@@ saa@@ c .

last night Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie had his 7@@ 7@@ th birthday .
her father was a state official , and her mother M@@ ary loved food .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie lear@@ nt from the Li@@ br@@ ary For@@ mu@@ la at the Uni@@ versity and , as expected young people would , even if possible , he went to dis@@ cover Europe .
while travelling to France , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie 's food love was only ob@@ sessi@@ ve and evol@@ ved .
in London , however , he met his first husband , J@@ ama@@ ica , with the roots of Mon@@ ty , with whom they opened up a food place in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , in 19@@ 64 , at T@@ he J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an Ho@@ us .
ten years later , the marriage broke down , and the j@@ oh@@ n closed the door .
in 1976 , he was already opening up a little bit of power for the people of Ms Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie Jos@@ s R@@ es@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , which was one of the most pri@@ ce@@ less food places in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne T@@ u for the next 21 years .
there is still talk of mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous orange so far as the first F@@ ine d@@ ining plant in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne ~ , which really knew how to value the raw material and offered seas@@ onal food - a fact that now seems to be the truth of the fence , but at the end of the last century it was not yet at all .
in 1997 , after 8 8 / 7 hur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane business , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie last night 's writing of Ko@@ kar@@ last - 15 of his pen .
there may be more food wri@@ ters in Estonia , but in his case no book has just been a reci@@ pe colle@@ ctor .
there have been vari@@ ations between Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie Ale@@ x@@ ander dogs for domestic che@@ f@@ s .
however , in order to work for her life , the lady considers the fifth co@@ car@@ ade - the su@@ pre@@ me one - T@@ he C@@ oo@@ k ' s Com@@ pan@@ ion ' - to be at least half a million homes by now .
for the first time in 199@@ 6 , the book emer@@ ged in the up@@ -to-@@ date version of 2004 and the latest version in 1987 .
in my boo@@ k@@ let , this is exactly what takes quite a lot of space in the 2004 output , because Im@@ pos@@ an@@ ts@@ -M@@ u has about a thousand reci@@ pes of 1@@ 12@@ 6 j@@ el !
however , the latest option is even more substantial .

it is a true co@@ qu@@ ee@@ -@@ bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al bi@@ ble , where , in addition to the reci@@ pes , various types of purchase and last night 's , food preparation will be presented and recommendations will be made for the purchase of vegetables .
there is a lot of cross-@@ reference in the alpha@@ be@@ tical order , and there is also a lot of cross-@@ reference - obviously , the education of the Li@@ br@@ ary 's dream did not run off the food ty@@ pe@@ writer by M@@ ist@@ ress .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie himself emphasi@@ ses that it was this book that changed his life and gave the last few to last last last last few days .
the feeling in the book that he has something to give to people led to the next large , kitchen garden , which our side is comparable to the school gar@@ den@@ s .
the R@@ AS@@ M@@ US M@@ oun@@ tain : the preparation hasn 't gone quite the way I saw it in my mind .
not everything has been exactly the same , as I saw in spirit , the M@@ oun@@ tain spoke of the training that prece@@ ded the M@@ ile .
on Re@@ e@@ de@@ l-@@ Saturday , there are important moments that show how the body is exactly .
and the competition will show you what we 're looking at here anyway .
on Day 8 , I believe that my preparation has been Bi@@ ble both in the years and in the previous years , so that it can be wa@@ tered down to normal .
with something special , on Sunday , there is no 13@@ .@@ 05 fore@@ ig@@ n-@@ u@@ ps M@@ oun@@ tain after the domestic Me@@ dia con@@ tests at the Oly@@ mp@@ ics .
the last deca@@ de is often over@@ done by training .
I 'm supposed to have the br@@ ush , and it might be very useful that the last week before the M@@ M was a little easier .
from the physical side , the days to the launch run like this : yesterday , the ri@@ pper res@@ ted , today he 's doing a war@@ m-@@ up tr@@ unk .
however , he does not want to ig@@ ni@@ te very much in his mental preparation : I will have my own rou@@ tin@@ es out in time .
there 's a lot of quiet and peace , and some rock mus@@ ic@@ i@@ ans I won 't let on my ears .
I do not need to look at any of these special vide@@ os or read self-@@ help books , but to be here and at this point the opportunity to assess that the children from all over the world have come together to compare their capa@@ bilities in one place .
it itself creates a special character .
the M@@ oun@@ tain , of course , is the top of the year for every li@@ ghter , and the M@@ oun@@ tain has taken all the pre-@@ launch , including the con@@ tests in the T@@ isu@@ al Lea@@ gue , as a test - trig@@ gered some technical nu@@ ances , comparing itself with some of the cells .
there is no longer a chance at the T@@ ic@@ kets Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships .
well , here 's the goal of a quick wa@@ it@@ ress called The M@@ oun@@ tain , but K@@ ä@@ gi says that if a pre@@ cur@@ sor and potentially also a semi@@ -@@ fin@@ al manage to leave even a percentage or a couple of things in reserve , they will certainly be a good thing for the next drink .
for the first time , the foun@@ der of Mid@@ dle@@ -@@ fire and last time goes without Jos@@ é@@ n@@ é@@ n himself .
we were thinking of Sa@@ vis@@ ar@@ t , or vice ver@@ sa .
now the Mid@@ lands must find their way without him .
in doing so , they also need to wave the party 's col@@ ours , the ' Cri@@ minal and embarras@@ sing ' - between the self-@@ su@@ ffe@@ rers of Sa@@ visa@@ are de de de and the expectations of the vo@@ ter .
the departure of Sa@@ visa@@ are will put the Middle A@@ ges in the most difficult position on the ground of the last last few years .
on the basis of what we 've been doing so far , the old n@@ y@@ ster vi@@ be is definitely playing over them .
a number of cards that used to hit the dru@@ ms may not be re@@ in@@ stated this time .
the P@@ op@@ ul@@ is@@ m@@ ö ar@@ t for Mid@@ dle@@ ll is not working , because Sa@@ visa@@ ar can always afford more than the last party .
the Russian card has been made difficult , both because of the position of the Mid@@ dle@@ ll and because , here too , we see the Sa@@ vin@@ o@@ va electoral union sin@@ king gas .
the victim 's card is already in Sa@@ visa@@ are 's pocket because of the ongoing trial .
the map of the People 's Fron@@ t and the In@@ te@@ res@@ ts has also disappeared to the Mid@@ lands .
the first of these is its creation , which is ham@@ pe@@ red by the L@@ DC and the second to play last last last .
however , one card may be of even greater weight .
all of the last elections have confirmed that it is S@@ wa@@ b who can and will then be able to carry it through the core of the elections .
the source has just been w@@ and@@ ering around Sa@@ visa@@ are .
if some of them had to breathe life into a well-@@ functioning confron@@ tation , then another dru@@ m is missing from the Mid@@ dle@@ -C@@ ard .
what 's left of the Middle A@@ ges ?
they still have a strong ja@@ r and a considerable T@@ EA .
there will also be enough sli@@ p@@ page in the run@@ -up to the elections .
with self-@@ advertising made with money from four years ago , I hope that the majority of them have now been re@@ paid .
T@@ all@@ in@@ na 's birds are still there , but there has been less than the cultivation of Wil@@ lia@@ ms ' gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ las .
in addition , there are pronounced mag@@ ne@@ ts .
their role will be to take the cas@@ tan@@ s out of fire this time , because the image of power is not enough to give voters considerable consideration .
in the meantime , George Ra@@ tas will have to find their way , because the journey ended with the sa@@ vi@@ ar this week .
a man who was drunk cli@@ mb@@ ed into a foreign car for sleep .

for the event , the p@@ ou@@ ch found a man who frea@@ ked himself out when he arrived at the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra .
the man had been tired for a moment on his journey and found a place in the back of a stran@@ ger 's car .

V@@ ide@@ o : Vas@@ sil@@ y@@ e@@ v has already hit the second pen@@ al for a new club .
Pi@@ as was already lost in a home@@ -@@ court game on W@@ ro@@ c@@ law S@@ las@@ k a minute and then tied him up 20 minutes later .
Vas@@ sil@@ je@@ v had a great opportunity to secure Pi@@ as@@ ti 's first win of the season .
four minutes before the Nor@@ mal was filled , the quar@@ ter@@ back missed the pen@@ al .
the match ended with a 1 : 1 tie .
in Pi@@ ast , two points have been made in four ro@@ unds , and they are in the top of the table , in the 15@@ th place .
the most stupid questions to put to the bar@@ tender .
Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st wa@@ ff@@ led to bar@@ ra@@ cks ' ears on questions that they would not like to hear .
what kind of drink do you think you can make best ?
some drinks do indeed have more parts than others , but it takes the same skills and blis@@ s to make them .
what gives them a signal that the climate is whatever it drinks , whether or not it is difficult to make a bar name .
what kind of drink do you like to make the most of ?
the same way that J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ ä@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ j@@ i would be the easi@@ est way to catch a co@@ ffin from the bar@@ tender right now .
it 's not for the bar@@ tender to say , but for the client to make the decisions by the th@@ ick@@ ness of his own wal@@ let .
rather , the question of whether there are any special offers at the moment would be awa@@ ited by bar@@ s .
what 's a good offer ?
perhaps behind this question is a purely cyc@@ lic@@ al desire to find out if the bar is distingu@@ ished from others , but it could be asked differently .
also , the bar@@ tender does not know what a customer would prefer at all .
could I have a drink that wouldn 't be very sweet ?
like the previous rule , the bar@@ tender does not know your flav@@ or and your preference and , for one , it may not be sweet for others .
but he 'll be willing to listen to what mag@@ nific@@ ent co@@ ke he wants .
does this drink give me headaches / han@@ go@@ ver ?

the Russian citizen , Er@@ n@@ est G@@ am@@ mer , who committed himself at the T@@ all@@ in@@ na N@@ ight C@@ lu@@ b in 2010 from an alien man , with serious health damage to him , has received the most ele@@ g@@ ant wanted list in Europe .
the Belgian authorities already knew of the contamination of the eggs in June .
as early as early as the beginning of June , we knew about the potential problems with the root fi@@ p@@ ron@@ ide of the K@@ at@@ ri@@ en S@@ tra@@ gi@@ er television channel V@@ R@@ T , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Belgian agency responsible for food safety , said in religion .
we were talking to the public prosecu@@ tor 's office immediately , because it could have been a sca@@ m .
from there , the investigation became secret .
we understand that people have questions about S@@ wa@@ b and are trying to respond to them by adding Sta@@ gi@@ er .
the news agency , the A@@ F@@ P , has been trying to get the information from the person concerned in recent days , but it did not say anything because the investi@@ g@@ ator refused to publish the information .
K@@ an@@ am@@ un@@ as have been removed from the market with precautions until the results of the analyses are available .

the German Minister for Agriculture , Chris@@ ti@@ an Schmidt , has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to quickly pick up two thousand .
apparently , someone has contaminated eggs with a banned product by a criminal nature , I@@ tem Schmidt at German His@@ tory Bil@@ d .
according to data from the Est@@ onian Food and Veterinary Office ( V@@ TA ) , the contaminated eggs produced by Ms Ó are not likely to be present in Estonia .
according to our information , the Dutch mun@@ e in Estonia is not A@@ 8 , V@@ TA 's spo@@ kes@@ man , Martin Al@@ tra@@ ja , said to B@@ N@@ S .
it also added that there are no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia .
according to the Statis@@ tical Office , no eggs from the Est@@ onian Netherlands have been imported in the last 10 years .
the last eggs from the Netherlands were delivered to Estonia in 2006 .
the Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticides on fi@@ p@@ ron@@ ide reached the can@@ als as a result of an attempt by the Dutch company Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ end to treat chickens suffering from the disease .
the reports from the Dutch and Belgian media that the substance containing the pesticide reached Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ end@@ in via the Belgian company have yet to be confirmed .
the larger tissues are moder@@ ately dangerous on the fi@@ p@@ ron@@ ide , according to the World Trade Organisation , and may have a negative impact on people , particularly children , kidneys , liver and sh@@ ale .
how do you keep sex ex@@ ci@@ tement when you 're trying to have a baby ?
it is therefore very important to keep the fla@@ me of pas@@ sion in the trap even if you are trying to create a new life .
F@@ ema F@@ ir@@ st is giving advice on how to make sex not look like an an@@ no@@ ying obligation .
don 't take this as an obligation
this could happen to any couple trying to get pregnant .
sometimes pregnancy can take years .
having sex on orders will take away spon@@ sor@@ ship and ro@@ man@@ tics .
try to be spon@@ sors !
women often feel that they are unable to reach the usual level of sex at the end of the sexual cycle of Jos@@ si , when it is known that there will be no positive outcome .
this leads to a relationship called ™ , which , in turn , leads to sexual activity and less sex , means , of course , an even greater opportunity not to become pregnant .
men feel , however , that they need to be able to appear at the time of de@@ man@@ ded .
if you know your fru@@ it@@ ful days ahead , it can be there for you to support something ro@@ man@@ tic with your sleep .
whether it 's a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy each other !
take a fru@@ it@@ ful period into account .
from the point of view of reproduction , there is no point at all to have sex when the u@@ pro@@ ar has taken place , but in order for your cou@@ p@@ les to thri@@ ve , try to have sex for the pleasure of non-@@ fru@@ it@@ ful days .
even though there is no evidence that pregnancy from the b b b below , when a woman gets or@@ gas@@ m , do not forget it !
remember , every couple is different .
everyone can deal with Be@@ eb@@ ine J@@ ell@@ y@@ fish differently .
some men want to be aware of a woman 's cycle , while others do not know that they would not feel the pressure on mbH to appear on them .
no one knows better than you guys about how you 're doing best .
find your solution !
studies have shown that there are cou@@ p@@ les in higher success sco@@ res who have sex every few days , but not every couple can hold this density .
the most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you best as a couple .
10 inf@@ eri@@ or type of it@@ ri@@ c to make the appearance of food
since many rooms are difficult to photogra@@ ph , the picture uses a completely different part of the ima@@ ges that de@@ ce@@ ives people - not milk , for example , instead of glu@@ e or ice cream .
Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be ™ i can@@ al to@@ p T@@ r@@ end@@ ing will out@@ line what tri@@ cks are quite common in the world of 8 .
if someone 's gonna pop a can or take a h@@ amb@@ ur@@ ger out of the box , there 's gonna be a lot of nice ste@@ am coming out of it .
in practice , the shot is longer , and during this whole time , the food is not ste@@ am , because ste@@ am comes from a water content called ' Te ' , which is not the case , for example .
that is why cotton ball is so@@ a@@ ked in the waters inside the package or the food , which has the capacity to absor@@ b and hold some water .
in the immediate vi@@ cin@@ ity of the tree , they will ste@@ am longer than Bur@@ ger or pop@@ cor@@ n and the product will be fre@@ sh@@ ly made .
potato pu@@ dding is a great assistant to photogra@@ ph@@ ers , because it does not start with protein or heat and does not significantly change the consistency of many others .
for example , instead of the full or ice ice cream of the cake , it could be mas@@ hed potatoes .
strange col@@ ors and dec@@ or@@ ative practices , and the consumer has been de@@ ce@@ ived again .
the glu@@ e re@@ places milk .
it 's not easy to photogra@@ ph milk , either , because it might not look so white in the photogra@@ ph .
also , mil@@ ky ser@@ vers quickly become squ@@ as@@ hed inside it .
since , for example , morning fla@@ kes or mol@@ as@@ ses have to look cris@@ py and tas@@ ty in milk , instead of milk , glu@@ e is used which is not passed through any cereal .
if the orange can make a lot of effort to make meat so that it will be ju@@ ic@@ y and ri@@ pe , then it will not be done in the S@@ ons .
however , it is precisely the meat that has been presented in L@@ ä@@ i that looks more like S@@ me@@ ll v , as if it came directly from the g@@ our@@ met .
however , it is often ro@@ as@@ ted on a pre@@ pped pan@@ el or made in the o@@ ven and dra@@ gged into the fle@@ sh a g@@ ri@@ ll with im@@ perfect stri@@ pes other than sho@@ e wa@@ x .
it 's just as difficult to work with whi@@ pped cream as it is with ice cream , because it 's a sou@@ p .
fortunately , there is a product that is almost identical to the appearance of whi@@ pped cream - a bar@@ ber wa@@ ist .
so it could be the cake or the ber@@ ries on top of the cake or the milk sa@@ che@@ ts .
there may be a thin wa@@ x that makes their appearance sh@@ allow .
however , this is not enough for a photogra@@ ph , and the addition of the fruit to the sh@@ iny app@@ endi@@ x will be s@@ pra@@ yed instead by a de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
the K@@ ast@@ ings are also not very pho@@ to@@ ge@@ en@@ ic , because in time , they will become liquid or water will be extra@@ cted from them , for example .
here , however , a wa@@ x is to be helped , with the deli@@ cate col@@ ors and the more permanent te@@ x@@ ture that will enable us to make a Ka@@ o@@ va pa@@ mp@@ h@@ let .
the fo@@ am is likely to have also been used in those pictures where chocolate on cake or ice cream on average will me@@ lt .
when you notice the perfect pas@@ sage cake on board , where the relationship between the b@@ is@@ qu@@ et and the ful@@ l-@@ time relationship is ide@@ al , there are probably additional la@@ yers or pieces of car@@ d@@ board .
that 's because by cutting open the cake , you can break out the do@@ ts and spo@@ il the picture .
if , after cutting , you push in the cake and s@@ pray them with the fil@@ ling , it makes you look much more beautiful .
the car@@ d@@ board and n@@ our@@ is@@ hment needles are also used in a bur@@ ger to put all the parts of last last few in place to keep them in place .
that 's why Bur@@ ger doesn 't seem like he 's on his desk .
paper for ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn chicken .
the fur@@ na@@ ce looks ju@@ ic@@ y and ful@@ l-@@ time , but it may not even be ready .
a ful@@ l-@@ time impression will be filled with chicken paper and , if necessary , g@@ rin@@ ded with the pre-@@ mentioned mas@@ hed potatoes and then s@@ pra@@ yed with the brown colour .
pan@@ ca@@ kes are particularly p@@ oured in the United States of America with ma@@ ple syrup , as this picture creates a large appetite for pan@@ ca@@ kes in people .
in fact , the cu@@ p@@ ca@@ kes rapidly infiltra@@ te the syrup , and with an open syrup , the photogra@@ p@@ her dis@@ appears quickly from under the eyes of the photogra@@ p@@ her .
therefore , each pan@@ cake is s@@ pra@@ yed over a di@@ v@@ ine@@ gar clean@@ er , which will help prevent rapid infil@@ tration .
it is often not helpful either , and so the gol@@ den bri@@ de is being used as an engine oil that is p@@ oured on warm pan@@ ca@@ kes and presented as syrup .
Estonia U@@ 18 redundan@@ cies in the semi@@ -@@ fin@@ ale of the United Kingdom and A@@ -@@ division will not make it .
the match began with a great deal of dyna@@ mics , and in the first quarter that the British won by five points ( 18 : 23 ) , many bas@@ kets were thrown .
in the second quarter , the difference is still large and the rest break was in the n@@ ine-@@ point success of the guests ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia will win the third quarter , but only one point .
the loss of the Est@@ oni@@ ans before the last ten minutes was two points ( 46 : 54 ) .
at the end of the day , Estonia 's game was completely blo@@ wn away by a quarter and , in the final analysis , a loss had to be adopted with the numbers 61 : 75 .
the loss crus@@ hed the Est@@ oni@@ ans to reach the A@@ -@@ division , because there are only two of the best of them .
in tomorrow 's third place game , Estonia will go to the Cro@@ ati@@ an - Israeli game with the loser .

it is worth knowing : how do you calculate how much sugar is in wait for S@@ wa@@ b ?
according to the European Union 's food labelling standards , the package can be highlighted by the quantity of hydro@@ carb@@ ons and the quantity of sugar@@ s , which are not at all white , the amount of so-called ' table meal ' - - Mr Kal@@ b@@ in , confirmed by V@@ ali@@ o Estonia 's Executive Director , Kris@@ ta Kal@@ b@@ in .
according to her , there are actually three types of sugar : milk lac@@ tone , the natural milk sugar , the g@@ ly@@ co@@ sis and f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s in des , and the added ratio , the sa@@ h@@ ha@@ roo@@ s .
however , bearing in mind a couple of key jour@@ neys by M@@ int , according to Kal@@ bin , there should be no difficulty in calculating the amount of added sugar contained in the product .
first of all , it needs to be made clear whether this is milk or acid .
normal milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk cream , or lac@@ to@@ se per 100 grams of product .
in H@@ ap@@ tened Dy@@ es , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or ke@@ e@@ fi@@ ri@@ bacteria have ea@@ ten part of the lac@@ to@@ sis during the ac@@ idi@@ fication process , resulting in ac@@ idi@@ fication by median inc@@ rement of 3,@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g of lac@@ to@@ se per product .
in order to calculate the amount of sugar that has been added , the first calculation is to be made from the quantity of sugar in the lac@@ tone , the word ' Kal@@ bin ' .
now , the quantity of sugar must be calculated by f@@ ru@@ c@@ t@@ oma and g@@ ly@@ co@@ sis originating in eggs and fruit .
as a general rule , between 3 % and 4 % of fruit in wait for f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and g@@ ly@@ co@@ sis flav@@ ours : about 0.3 grams and , in particular , about 15 % of fruit in products up to 1,5 grams per 100 grams of fruit , Kal@@ b@@ in said .
according to him , this simple calculation shows that the percentage of added sugar in yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts may be up to twice as low as the percentage of sugar@@ s indicated as th@@ ick@@ ening .
the situation is slightly different in the case of L@@ ak@@ to@@ sian products , as the sugar content depends on production technology .

why do dogs eat gras@@ s ?
sometimes it 's thought that a dog ea@@ ts gras@@ s when he doesn 't feel well and wants to vo@@ mit .
in fact , most dogs that eat gras@@ s are completely healthy .
only less than 10 % of the dogs that bite the gras@@ s are doing it because of the disease called J@@ ell@@ -@@ B .
one of the reasons why a dog can suddenly start eating gras@@ s can be the room table of the room .
those dogs with wor@@ ms can also be more interested in mo@@ an@@ ing the gras@@ s .
therefore , when a dog that has never che@@ wed on the gras@@ s before has suddenly grown up in the gras@@ s , and it often ea@@ ts it , it would be wor@@ th@@ while to have control of the ar@@ tist in order , for example , to quickly get possible di@@ ges@@ tive organs , i. e .
it 's worth men@@ tioning that a dog can gu@@ ilt the gras@@ s because he likes its taste or he 's just bo@@ red .
if the health problem is ruled out , it would be worth making sure that the family lem@@ ma is still receiving sufficiently co@@ war@@ dly and desperate activities .

last month , a fallen plane took part in joint exer@@ ci@@ ses in the state of S@@ ho@@ al@@ wa@@ ter Bay in the Qu@@ ofi s@@ land .
Mrs Pa@@ y@@ ne , Minister of De@@ fence , said that the Saturday incident took place near the S@@ ho@@ al@@ way Ba@@ y l@@ oun@@ ge .
sou@@ th-@@ sou@@ th@@ west is preparing for the arrival of the ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u .
a large part of the sou@@ th-@@ west region , including the regions devasta@@ ted last month by the ra@@ info@@ rest , was prepared to get even more ra@@ inf@@ all than the ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u , which , at one point , was the stron@@ gest storm in the world , was moving closer and closer to the country 's holiday islands .
according to the Mari@@ time Office , the sou@@ th-@@ west Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u island is hit by heavy win@@ ds and heavy ra@@ inf@@ all on the south of Friday , about 13@@ 50 km from T@@ ok@@ yo , with a ra@@ inf@@ all on the south of Friday , and it is possible that hundreds of hundreds of up to 800 m@@ m will fall over the next 48 hours .
the representative of the Mari@@ time Agency said that Nor@@ u , which would subsequently turn a certain type of de@@ er in Kore@@ an , would probably turn north and sp@@ ill over Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u with the rain , although the main sections hit last month by the ra@@ info@@ res@@ ts and L@@ ights , which killed 36 people and left four missing , are likely to escape the worst of all .
last but not least , last but not least , last but not least , it is a very slow , slow storm last year , and it added a note that there is therefore a greater floo@@ d risk , as there is a rain in one region over a longer period .
Nor@@ u , which at one point was a ty@@ pho@@ on of Ca@@ teg@@ ory 5 and is an un@@ usually long storm , was formed first two weeks ago and w@@ and@@ ering round 8 in the nor@@ thern part of the O@@ ce@@ an before heading to the nor@@ th@@ west by taking Japan and weak@@ ening its approach .
the representative added that , depending on the change in course , Nor@@ u can move directly across Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and then along the H@@ on@@ sh@@ u Islands in Japan , but it is still difficult to identify a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term journey .
the plane drew a perfect image of itself over the United States .
the pilot has led to a si@@ x@@ a@@ tic trans@@ national flight over the United States of America and even a bit of enter@@ tainment on the route of 8 .
air vehicle data in real time amoun@@ ted to the fact that it was not just a si@@ r@@ ge line or a cro@@ w , but a series of air@@ ways that formed an image of an aer@@ op@@ lane with each other .

last night D@@ re@@ am@@ lin@@ er took over Mon@@ tan@@ a , North Da@@ ko@@ ta and Min@@ nes@@ o@@ ta east , before changing course and le@@ an@@ ing towards the E@@ de@@ la .
from map 1 2 , the plane represents a strange route with two engines ...
according to Bo@@ e@@ ing , an air vehicle is part of the 18@@ -@@ hour last night 's test on last last week 's Day .
instead of flying any pattern , the testing team released their imag@@ ination on the route from which 22 purcha@@ ses a 7@@ 8@@ 7@@ -@@ 8 consu@@ me me 8 , spoke of a representative of Ms Com@@ pan@@ y in Bali for R@@ T@@ .@@ c@@ om@@ al .

former soldier at the prison for murder of a pension@@ er suspected of being sexu@@ ally ab@@ used
a former soldier , I@@ ike , for at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man who he suspected of ab@@ using a woman he knew .
Mr Cas@@ sid@@ y ( 70 ) in June G@@ las@@ go@@ w was guilty of the murder of David F@@ ar@@ at ( 75 ) at his home in T@@ we@@ ed@@ bank in Ro@@ x@@ bur@@ gh@@ shire , 6@@ th .
the murder of Ju@@ dge Lord S@@ um@@ mm@@ ers Te was a particularly distur@@ b b by the victim 's body with 14 pun@@ cture w@@ ounds .
Brian Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e , a defense at@@ torney in Ri@@ ig@@ in@@ ity , said that murder was caused by a momen@@ tary ma@@ dness at last last last last last , but he took ' em ' as last last last last last night .
Cas@@ sid@@ y heard that F@@ ar@@ ish had been sexu@@ ally ab@@ using a woman for a long time .
his lawyer said that he went home to F@@ ari@@ te and he was friends with him to hear a conf@@ ession , not plan to kill him .
Lord S@@ um@@ yers claimed that Cas@@ sid@@ y showed only signs on the day of the attack , and pointed out in social work , which revealed that the defend@@ ant had received special training in the army on how to infiltra@@ te groups through friendship .
no acc@@ us@@ ations had been made to F@@ ar@@ b@@ ys .
it was reported in the court that after the murder , Cas@@ sid@@ y conta@@ cted the police and turned himself in .
Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e announced that it would be difficult for people to understand that Cas@@ sid@@ y is capable of murder .
the defense lawyer said : he has never had problems in his life before that date .
he lived a full life up to that stra@@ y moment in ' 6 .
Cas@@ sid@@ y 's health is alle@@ ge@@ dly poor and has been caught in the middle of last night 's private training and enthusias@@ m .
according to Lord S@@ um@@ mer@@ s , he took into account the fact that Cas@@ sid@@ y did not have previous things on last last last last time in prison , and what he alle@@ ge@@ dly said was about F@@ ar@@ tem .
last week 's Day , the case of the police at last last last night was ' cause of the particularly ap@@ pal@@ ling murder of a male population in his own home , d@@ é@@ ten@@ te . '

important issues in the debate on last week , such as the development of a small island with air and ship between last night .
the state has committed itself to providing regular transport links in small islands with a permanent nature but , for example , during the period 06@@ b , traffic also makes important jour@@ neys by local residents .
these are the places where the country will be able to receive local Te at an early stage and take account of the needs of the last few days , in the words of the Prime Minister .
in addition , the issues of the construction of a port of vessels , of interest education , of safety and of rescu@@ es were discussed .
today 's visit to V@@ or@@ ms was the last part of the circle of the small islands of last night to look at the island 's lif@@ es@@ ty@@ les and to look at the questions a@@ waiting local residents and execu@@ tives .
in the Stra@@ its , the head of government tra@@ ve@@ led the island , the T@@ reas@@ ury , the Ru@@ h@@ n@@ u , the Ab@@ ru@@ ka and the Vil@@ lage , and the Man@@ il@@ ai , in a month of h@@ oles , he will be ~ the Women 's Islands , the P@@ ran@@ g@@ li and the A@@ e@@ vo@@ s .
the cold summer has led the Est@@ oni@@ ans to the highest extent that package tri@@ ps are not only expensive , but have been sold out regardless of price .
also , cheap air tickets and last minute tickets are not to be expected , and it is better to think about next year 's travel plans .
at yesterday 's press conference , a member of the National Assembly , Ol@@ ga I@@ van@@ o@@ va , who joined the elections in E@@ D@@ G@@ A@@ R Sa@@ visa@@ are , said that the Sa@@ visa@@ are@@ -@@ I@@ va@@ r Su@@ pre@@ me Ele@@ ctor@@ al Union offers healthy competition to the Middle A@@ ges in the internal elections in T@@ all@@ in@@ na .
however , how is it likely that E@@ D@@ G@@ A@@ R Sa@@ visa@@ ar ’ s cooperation in U@@ r@@ mas Ho@@ t L@@ and electoral activities T@@ all@@ in@@ n ™ would be appreci@@ ated ?

the game was s@@ tun@@ ning .
both teams had done their ho@@ mework , the do@@ ts were heavy .
the game comes with someone who 's got better ner@@ ves .
P@@ la@@ y@@ -@@ of@@ f may be a one-@@ two-@@ shot game of eight or two , discussing Re@@ go .
Yeah , but the coach 's still looking for something to fix first .
you can always compla@@ in .
some of our things weren 't justified , the op@@ pon@@ ent got light free@@ z@@ ers and lived on them .
this is what has happened to us - if you are aggressive about protecting people , you are in danger .
let 's make our own conclusions , let 's hear Re@@ go .
he used a j@@ olly player today , and R@@ ob@@ in K@@ iv@@ i left behind because of the injury of some of the meetings was still on the ben@@ ch .
these decisions are being made on an ongoing basis .
the stone contributed to the training and pre-@@ game war@@ m@@ th , but was not 100 % ready to go to the head of last week 's head .
tomorrow , at 18@@ .@@ 15 p.m. , Estonia will meet in the semi@@ fin@@ als , T@@ ru , who today def@@ ea@@ ted Bulgaria at 76 : 73 .
the winner of this game will raise his country 's U@@ 18 age bra@@ cket to the next eight E@@ M division .
a woman found a wedding ring in the ba@@ se@@ room ... who could it be ?
~ I started to take the nest ~ ~ ~ As a bright was@@ her rubber between myself in my eye ~ ~ ~ ~ She speaks of how she found a we@@ d@@ ded wedding ring in her nest ~ ~
in fact , Kar@@ in didn 't pay attention to the sh@@ iny ones at the door with the first blow .
I put the machine back on .
next to two small children , there will be this fil@@ thy nest right next to two young children , and there will be a woman .
when the second was@@ h@@ out was over , and I started taking out the was@@ h@@ out , there was still this bright was@@ h@@ room rubber between myself , and I found this si@@ p in my eye .
the gol@@ den wedding ring is en@@ gra@@ ved with the name of the man who married 14 years ago , Tom@@ i .
because someone in a family with this name , a man or a woman who could be married to a guy named Tom , doesn 't know , it 's a total my@@ ster@@ y .
Kar@@ in investigated an older child that maybe he 's found a si@@ eve , put it in his pocket , and the dou@@ gh@@ nut has come down to pes@@ us through there , but the kid confirmed that he didn 't bring the si@@ eve home .
Kar@@ in has been living in a apartment on the streets of T@@ all@@ in@@ nas M@@ ad@@ ala for a year with a mate of his life .
they used to rent it out , and from then on , I used to wash it .
but if the cur@@ ve should have something to do with the ten@@ ants , how did it end up in last last night ?
now I 'm de@@ man@@ ded and unable to understand the path of a si@@ zz@@ le to pes@@ u@@ 8 land , a woman lau@@ g@@ hed .
because life expec@@ tancy next to two little kids is fast , then I forgot the find at home for the first time on top of the clo@@ set .
recently recently , there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring , and it now seemed that it was high time to look for the owner of the friendship that he found himself , Mr Ő@@ land , refers to the case of Kar@@ in Social Affairs , where the wedding ring found on the streets of the outbreak in T@@ all@@ in@@ na happ@@ ily found the owner last week .
as F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k finds and sear@@ ches for different things , I was thinking of trying to try happ@@ iness there , Kar@@ in speaking , who has already been pos@@ ted by nearly 4@@ ,000 people .
the Po@@ sti@@ tus has been exposed to suspended last night and not all is good - a woman , I@@ -I@@ -I , has been advised to take her husband over .
there was a feeling it needed this shit now .
that my husband has become the biggest che@@ a@@ ter I 've ever heard of .
to tell you the truth , it made me first , but later on , when the Me@@ ts came to me , that maybe I myself have sa@@ c@@ ke@@ red the don@@ u@@ ts , it made me laugh .
the com@@ mand@@ ers also suggested that maybe a si@@ eve with the Naz@@ i has reached the second round in the po@@ ckets of the stri@@ ps .
the last time I saw one last six months ago , I know you got a job job job with a hand@@ ful of $ 2@@ s , which , without a more in-@@ depth investigation , l@@ ent into pes@@ o@@ sia , but is that right ?
be that as it may , with a mate of life together , Mr 8 : 00 , that now , for the sake of the principle , we need to find the owner of the si@@ re .
whatever the cause of this si@@ bl@@ ings .
divorce , family quar@@ rel , whatever .
I think this is the only right thing to do , because if I ever lost a wedding ring , I know I would be most grateful to someone who would try to find me and return property .
Kar@@ in is also at the stand@@ point of Ms J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ i to get help from there , the owner of the aid .
however , I received an answer that Estonia had a date like this , and that Mr. Mis@@ ter has not been married .
one si@@ eve has found the owner .
recently , a wedding ring found in T@@ all@@ in@@ na P@@ el@@ gu@@ ran@@ na on 21 July happ@@ ily returned to the owner , the gra@@ ve@@ ling promised to suggest that it belon@@ ged to the devil .
I walked dogs this morning , and I noticed an outbreak in 53 houses , inside a sta@@ mped path , a gol@@ den si@@ re called Jo@@ b , tells Ger@@ li that the gra@@ ve@@ ling promised to assume that it belon@@ ged to an e@@ ac@@ le .
Ger@@ li pos@@ ted a photogra@@ ph of the R@@ ing ( picture ) on his F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k page and group " s " in T@@ all@@ in@@ nas 8 , dis@@ cer@@ ned , shared information with the Northern T@@ all@@ in@@ na Coun@@ try and the North Pre@@ fec@@ ture .
in two weeks , the police conta@@ cted Ger@@ l and reported that the anti-@@ mur@@ derer had been identified .
the ring was gone because the old lady had broken her hand and put her sister at the other end of the cur@@ ve , where it had sli@@ pped away .
he lost it the same day in the morning , when I walked my dog into I@@ ke , says Ger@@ li .
you still have to go to the woods for whatever reason .
but if there 's a chill in the skin , then it 's time to make a little tea drink .
there are plenty of resources for this in the forest .
protect the home , make a little review .
we are talking about tea because the coffee and the real road contain ca@@ ffe@@ ine , which , although inc@@ al@@ cu@@ la@@ ble to a certain extent , is not the best thing for our health .
using plants found in the free environment , it is always necessary to be prepared for testing , because both prescri@@ ptions and mag@@ nific@@ ent ones are different .
some plants do not need a long stick , only with hot water on top , while others must be left to be left to be drawn into two .
of course , it must also be careful that water and plants are clean enough .
a great deal also depends on the time and place of the harvest .
let us now take a closer look at how to produce a few drinks of tea and what impact they may have on us .
gan@@ g@@ ban@@ g tea
the gan@@ g@@ way may be easy for the year .
if there is a good supply of two litres of water per day , this path will be good enough to satisfy also the need for vitamin C and also to provide some extra energy .
as with all plants , it is also possible to get hold of the pine trees using using the method called " 8 " , such as crus@@ hing bran@@ ches - not having to cook for long , it will be enough to get over@@ water and draw for a few hours with hot water .
for half a litre of water , it takes 0.4 litres of thor@@ ns , which will come from bo@@ iling for 15 minutes .
the result is a drink that contains about 25 m@@ g of vitamin C , a lot of ka@@ ali@@ um and a check .
in addition , the drink contains about 1.5 cu@@ bes of sugar , or about 20 k@@ cal sugar .
le@@ mon and honey can always be added to improve the taste of the mo@@ th@@ balls .
and when the drink got ugly sti@@ ff , it can be crus@@ hed with water like syrup .
it 's the same thing to do when you make the moon tea , but the drink itself tas@@ tes a little different .
the V@@ ar@@ y@@ a@@ g is excellent and helps against a great many trou@@ bles , from the re@@ um@@ our to the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ low@@ ers .
V@@ ar@@ ia helps to overcome fatigue , is P@@ ain@@ -@@ cu@@ t@@ tin and helps with col@@ d-@@ su@@ cking disease , both as a co@@ d@@ fish ea@@ ter and as a hu@@ mi@@ lia@@ tor of Le@@ g .
as a result , it would not be worth more than half a litre a day .
the water drink is also a swe@@ at , which is why , in winter , a more peaceful moment should be found to absor@@ b it .
to make a drink in the winter , take a fresh cro@@ w rod , at the time of sum@@ mer@@ time , use leaves , nets or ber@@ ries .
for a half a litre of drink , it will take a small cap of the perfect length of the drink , which will be laid until the water has the tone of the red .
you can also make a pull out of V@@ ar@@ ice 's th@@ ie@@ ves .
to do that , break the stra@@ w and keep them warm for a few hours .
longer and more thorough work will also make the drink stronger .
ready ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry pie can also be added to the pine pi@@ er road .
Bla@@ ck@@ bus@@ ter tea .
the Bla@@ ck@@ nut is a car@@ pen@@ ter that looks like a piece of wood in the wild .
it 's mostly found in sau@@ ces , but also elsewhere .
the area of use of the Se@@ ene is very much I@@ ike - a hot yo@@ ga , a fire , instead of a virus , etc .
you can wash yourself very well with as@@ hes .
the Bla@@ ck@@ bus@@ ter is a super@@ be@@ verage that can be used to treat a large number of diseases , even cancer , or to relax , to reduce the stress of T@@ ine@@ m , to reduce life expec@@ tancy .
Se@@ en contains several unique units and many vita@@ min@@ s B , as well as anti@@ oc@@ y@@ tes and some miner@@ als and proteins .
tea made from the fun@@ gus can be made every day , there is no risk of over@@ consumption .
to make a drink , approximately 3 x 3 c@@ m of s@@ coo@@ p , which comes in a 2-@@ 3 litre of water with a bo@@ i@@ lers of between 5 and 15 minutes .
a woman wal@@ ks around the world on foot : my daily budget is $ 5 !

in the second week , I joined one of them last week 's home@@ less deca@@ de old old old old old guy .
O@@ i , don 't think some f@@ ag@@ go@@ ts or something : we were just sleeping in the same park in M@@ en@@ ton and becoming friends , even though he was 15 years old than I was , was a good compan@@ ion .
turns out the man 's family , the Par@@ i@@ is , the former French Na@@ vy officer .
Al@@ ko@@ t does not use , do no sca@@ ms , in short , a decent person , an intelligent , pleasant communic@@ ator , seen in life .
I joined him together , and the next three weeks we tra@@ ve@@ led together , from town to town , and also about five bucks a day .
the money was still coming , so much as you can live .
the man taught me how , at night , to provide assistance in closed hotel@@ s and edi@@ ted or@@ ans on farms and farms .
we worked exactly enough to make it two or three days of food money , and then ...
at some point , I stayed at the l@@ oun@@ ge , and I decided I wouldn 't be able to ...
I took the flight to Hel@@ sing , home from there .
Oh , and by the way , J@@ ä@@ ä@@ u@@ mi .
those 40 days must have been the best in my life .
J@@ ür@@ gen has recently been in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : last week 's ci@@ ta@@ te is a poor recital :
that is why I am not going to look back , and I am not going to recall what has been done to re@@ build human nature in history and what results have been achieved .
I do not assess whether these attempts can be considered a success or a failure .
I also avoided excessive references to sources , even though I would support the idea of my most important teacher , T@@ olly Paul : all my thoughts are from somewhere on borro@@ wing , if only one could remember where exactly .
the current Est@@ onian plan of events is to re@@ build a citizen of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect person .
we do not raise him like we raise a child - a good slo@@ gan that he will become a man .
we will bring him up to the extent that the classes of Mi@@ ho@@ s imagine it - what one person must be , that he can live in Estonia and speak open@@ ly .
cen@@ sor@@ ship is perfect .
although the local classes changed partly a year ago , some of the growing methods are as scary as those of the previous ruling class , the now im@@ pover@@ ished no@@ ble no@@ ble@@ man - they are not going to fall far below the last last last eight .
they 're just J@@ ell@@ -@@ O 's .

the domin@@ ant class includes not only those politicians who will be able to get their jobs for their work , but also those self-@@ aware who will be doing politics volun@@ tari@@ ly ( reading : 8 : 00 ) : by using the statu@@ e of Mik@@ h@@ kel , by using the statu@@ e of Ms 8 : F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , how terrible people around them live in Estonia , lon@@ gi@@ ants , ju@@ gg@@ les , tail dogs .
they only agree with EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber j@@ i ( an expression of the English about people living in a space that only has opinions that are appropriate to them , such as their own friends of F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k ) , but this is not possible in the conflict in Estonia .
there are still some fellow men who think or do something that is intole@@ rable to the ech@@ o .
and the war of words is open and the b@@ ann@@ ers are b@@ lowing .
we have a number of politicians who know exactly how many people can sleep with , how many children can bre@@ ed , how to work , how much to do , what to get , when to think , what to think about , how to enter@@ tain , when to be sick , how to die .
in very important places .
if something other than what they have said to their I@@ ts , they are fu@@ rious , off@@ ended , hy@@ steri@@ cal .
the fact that in a number of European countries , people with their heads full of ~ ~ car - and this is allowed by law - their opinion will not come true .
Ms tole@@ rant is the only mu@@ d@@ dle promised in all areas , but there is not ca@@ rele@@ ssness , but evil , behind the tolerance of Ms Ő@@ i .
class hat@@ red and fa@@ ts - only people like me are good .
the hol@@ y politicians can only open the mouth , but never the heart .
they believe that any measure called ' 10 ' , with which they will improve society , will work and will be worth a test .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for them , we have g@@ lit@@ ter bel@@ ls of sufficient size , min@@ d-@@ disabled s@@ tun@@ ts , ju@@ mping through every window without feeling the pain .
that is why it seems to us , when a pe@@ as@@ ants in ' 8 ' are bea@@ ten up by ' 8 ' on the man@@ sion sta@@ ll from ' 8 ' , it seems to us that this is a sensible thing .
some of the words that will definitely send us to the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e are , for example , gay , refugee , woman , violence , work , etc .
if you believe in everything that self-@@ interest officials , Jos@@ ys and politicians ( such things are only a small part of all groups , but they can ro@@ b in such a way that society as a whole compla@@ ins ) talk and write , the citizen is not only an ab@@ om@@ ination , a vul@@ gar and a bra@@ in@@ less one , but also a bra@@ in@@ less one .
but let us not believe , do not force you to tole@@ rate , do not for@@ bid drinking .
in any case , the Est@@ onian person drinks as much as he wants , not as much as the country allows .
in any case , the Est@@ onian person will tole@@ rate more if he is not allowed to tole@@ rate .
the Est@@ onian person will not only change his behaviour two months before the elections so that , after achieving the objective , he will not only s@@ mas@@ h his back into his mouth , but also ex@@ ec@@ ute what quickly resto@@ res his brain fat frag@@ ments .
whoever does otherwise is not the right way to go .
I don 't think there 's a single person who 's been able to get around last night .
I believe that a person can be taught .
to drink , to love my family , to be a har@@ d-@@ working , poli@@ te , attractive compan@@ ion , not only with Me@@ ts , but with all of them .
in order to teach you , you don 't have to be fined all the time . no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
the teacher must set an example .
a smo@@ kin ' politici@@ an talks about the harm@@ ful@@ ness of L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise ?
a police officer in excess of speed in his spare time will make me a fine for crossing him ?
and then you get stuck with your head , then you get caught ...
I have this idea that , perhaps , we should re@@ vol@@ ve around the last time around 8 8 to 8 .
tell them not to drink in secret .
when you drink , drink open@@ ly , in the square of the town hall , in the eyes of the whole nation .
to ex@@ ec@@ ute the most ex@@ or@@ c@@ ism only open@@ ly - the ru@@ lers , including the private spirit , be all red .
if you rule , rule as you rule yourself .
perhaps the shame will be enough if the words and Ms J@@ ill do not co@@ inci@@ de .
or we 'll find out that we want to be governed by the most aff@@ lu@@ ent .
because all of us , the fore@@ ig@@ ners , are what we don 't want to be at all .

the bus driver rescu@@ ed eight pu@@ ppi@@ es on the side of the road , not knowing that the dogs actually have their owners .
where I put these eight pu@@ ppi@@ es , I would have been thrown out of the apartment with the dogs by a woman , by a bus driver called " O@@ le@@ g " , who rescu@@ ed the post-@@ 2008 dog pu@@ ppi@@ es who fucked around the road , hand@@ ing them over to the employee .
soon , however , the owner of the dogs became apparent , for whom it became in@@ comprehen@@ sible why the pu@@ ppi@@ es were taken away from his home .
the Har@@ ju@@ land bus driver , O@@ le@@ g , said that he had been working as a bus driver since the beginning of 199@@ 0s , but this case has never happened before in his career . I was driving a bus number 14@@ 6 on my usual route .

I thought it was a rac@@ co@@ on , but it turns out it was the four pu@@ ppi@@ es at last , just like the bus driver .
O@@ le@@ k got cold , and he stopped a fully loaded bus of ' em for pu@@ ppi@@ es after cor@@ ps .
the damage would have gone over them , and the dogs would have crus@@ hed him , the word " O@@ le@@ g . "
he added that M@@ ini@@ on was , and they were also offered , soft tissue injections with great joy .
the pu@@ ppi@@ es were a little scared at first , but then they turned into fun .
pu@@ ppi@@ es on board , the bus driver went into a new circle because the schedule needed to be followed .
once again , he missed the pu@@ ppi@@ es ' in@@ vention , and he saw four other little dogs there .
it was the Ka@@ er@@ a pu@@ ppi@@ es .
they were so flu@@ ffy , and you could see they were taken care of .
the dogs were beautiful . they were amazing .
the first thought was , of course , that someone wanted to get rid of them somehow , the bus driver said that , for this reason , he decided to carry the pu@@ ppi@@ es on the bus .
I picked up those four pu@@ ppi@@ es , too , and I was g@@ lowing at the police . I was remin@@ ded of O@@ le@@ g .
the law enforcement conta@@ cted T@@ all@@ in@@ na animals , which had an employee to follow the pu@@ ppi@@ es ' station at last .
but didn 't the bus driver have a gift for himself ?
that was the idea .
a dog boy was so beautiful and peaceful .
two hundred and twen@@ ty-@@ eight nice as a ful@@ l-@@ grown dog , y@@ um , y@@ ö@@ u said .
but where do I put these eight pu@@ ppi@@ es ?
I would have been thrown out of the apartment with the dogs .
we still have a little kid .
it 's too soon to take a dog@@ gie . it 's added .
the head of T@@ all@@ in@@ na 's animals , E@@ ve To@@ ň , has confirmed that there were really 8 ' 2 ' and a half month old pu@@ ppi@@ es coming in .
but on the same day , the owner has come for the pu@@ ppy family .
we didn 't even push these pu@@ ppi@@ es in and let them back at you , he marked .
the owner of the eggs was not very gru@@ mp@@ y , but he did say that they had the only house to the extent of Ms 8 and that the bus driver could have asked if the pu@@ ppi@@ es belon@@ ged to them , told them about Thomas .
the driver added , however , that it is a good thing that a bus driver picked up bra@@ ts on the road by Me@@ ts and therefore did not happen to them .
in fact , it was very good of the bus driver that he did not !
there are dates on the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e where , if necessary , conventional vehicles simply do not escape at their best .
that 's where they 're at the A@@ TV .
from the A@@ TV , which is in the area of I@@ tem , gave an over@@ view of the home of the De@@ fen@@ se !
~ There is nothing new in the use of vehicles with li@@ ght@@ weight and good penet@@ ration ~ ~ ~ in structures .
the need for them has already emer@@ ged during II@@ IB , but more attention was given to them a deca@@ de later .
simp@@ lic@@ ity and â  ª
in W@@ ill@@ ys O@@ ver@@ land , as early as 6 years ago , the M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 , known as the mechan@@ ical mu@@ ul@@ a , was dra@@ gged out of O@@ ver@@ land fac@@ tories , from a vehicle designed for the wrec@@ kage of the w@@ ounded in recent years .
it is a little strange for me to say a little more about the mechan@@ ical .
it 's hard to imagine an As@@ ke@@ et vehicle .
" with Ste@@ ga " , " seat " and " rose " : everything , all of the lo@@ ck@@ down .
as if the To@@ ys ' To@@ w@@ ers were too heavy to steal the draw@@ ings from the engine@@ er 's desk and start production quickly .
yet in the war , there is more comfort than I can see .
there was no op@@ pon@@ ent of the mu@@ le placed in this category by the Ju@@ d@@ ge@@ les ( CO@@ s ) .
it was hardly easy , less than five hundred kil@@ ome@@ ters , and weighing eight eight , to bury a ne@@ ck@@ lace in places where my super@@ -@@ di@@ ame@@ ter , J@@ ell@@ -@@ O famous famous W@@ ill@@ ys Je@@ e@@ p , was supposed to show bra@@ king lights .
two hundred and fif@@ ty kil@@ os of transpor@@ tation was used in transpor@@ tation work , both for the transpor@@ tation of po@@ ppi@@ es and for the transpor@@ tation of mer@@ ch@@ ant .
sometimes , they got la@@ me on the back , little bit li@@ ghter , with little Bar@@ na@@ by 's anti-@@ tank weapons .
however , this type of truck was caught under fire , and it still happened , the driver was able to move the ste@@ ering system ' s in the last mess and to let it be so low that the vehicle could be driven to the b@@ lun@@ t sheep .
the mu@@ les were produced up to 19@@ 70 , asse@@ mb@@ led 11 2@@ 40 , and were deploy@@ ed in the army until 19@@ 80 , when the race was replaced for H@@ M@@ W@@ V@@ s .
two decades ago , A@@ T@@ V@@ d ( A@@ T@@ V@@ d ) circu@@ lated rather margin@@ ally .
back to the picture , they came after New Tes@@ ts fell into the as@@ hes , and US soldiers found themselves w@@ res@@ tling in the deser@@ t land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of Iraq and Afghanistan .
it is precisely there that J@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ ä@@ u@@ e@@ va knows that there is a need for something that requires something that is the vo@@ id between H@@ um@@ we@@ e and the inf@@ an@@ try .
since the A@@ T@@ V@@ s do not generally provide considerable protection , they are not exactly the best option to carry out their battle tasks .
well , J@@ ell@@ -@@ O and L@@ ight@@ -@@ y@@ a@@ ms are fit for special tasks .
for example , in intelligence and rescue operations .
there are now thousands of A@@ T@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ V@@ s in the American army .
most of them , such as De@@ fen@@ se So@@ il X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50@@ s , are essentially similar to those in civil turnover , but improved in accordance with the needs of the army .
the names such as K@@ aw@@ as@@ a@@ ki Mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ d@@ alt ran@@ c@@ he@@ r and F@@ o@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ ah@@ alt R@@ hin@@ o and Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c C@@ at and the increasingly wide selection of the Pol@@ ar@@ is models of the manufacturer of F@@ if@@ th A@@ T@@ V@@ de have been represented by trade .
in 2013 , in Pol@@ ar@@ is , a five-@@ year agreement was signed on the American Special Centre ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) , with the two-@@ seat M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 4 ( OL@@ D ) ) , and a separate five-@@ year agreement on the M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50@@ s made at the Pol@@ ar@@ is S@@ por@@ ts@@ man base , with both inf@@ ra@@ p@@ un@@ a-@@ and b@@ la@@ ck@@ -@@ ou@@ t-@@ protein ty@@ res and live bee ty@@ res providing mobile ty@@ res . we can get a hit after a 50-@@ c@@ ali@@ ber weapon .
before M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 entered the market , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 arrived at Pol@@ ar to deliver M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 to the army .
the M@@ V@@ 700 is a military version of Pol@@ ar@@ is 7@@ 00@@ c@@ c T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man , which has been added and w@@ rap@@ ped in advance , a du@@ al fuel tank through the larger distan@@ ces , the frame and the bottom , and yet another edi@@ tion with which farmers or other ha@@ mm@@ ers in the forest will not have more to do .
in the same way as the John De@@ ere M@@ -@@ G@@ ators , who were successfully used by the Pol@@ ar@@ is A@@ T@@ V@@ de , it is equipped with armed streng@@ ths , with asi@@ res@@ ts on the hood and with some other elements that are useless in the ran@@ ch but necessary in the fight .
a vehicle weighing 750 kil@@ ome@@ ters can carry almost its body weight , or , to be more precise , 5@@ 70 kil@@ os of cra@@ ms .
the power of the engine will also be sufficient to transport li@@ ghter after@@ -@@ whe@@ els and arti@@ lle@@ ry parts .
a modified box in the back of the box , which is remo@@ vable , makes it possible to drive from point A to point B to Asia , which is larger than the size of that small but te@@ na@@ cious piece of wood .
subsequently , the enhanced version A@@ 1 of M@@ -@@ G@@ ator@@ i , which is more powerful than the original 20-@@ hob@@ by M@@ -@@ G@@ ator , and the subsequent L@@ F@@ 2 , which is even better to carry and to@@ w , and the A@@ 3 , which combin@@ es the positive characteristics of A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 .
in fact , the M@@ -@@ G@@ ators were already in ' em in ' 77 and ' 98 , where the medical bri@@ ga@@ des used them to the Sp@@ ring@@ ers of the w@@ ounded .
at the same time , they also reduced the burden on the soldiers on their own feet by dra@@ gging them into a c@@ rane which , otherwise , would have had to be carried on the back .
while the majority of existing power structures have mo@@ di@@ fications from vehicles used in civil lif@@ ts , there are also some exceptions .
the spirit of these is P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x Inter@@ nation@@ alis , with the name " Pro@@ w@@ ň " , Ar@@ at@@ su , which has been successfully used around the world in battle , le@@ an and rescue missions .
according to the manufacturer , they were first introduced 10 years ago and , in the case of vehicles created by Special O@@ per@@ ations , trans@@ posed by the usual A@@ T@@ V@@ s , as well as those that have been mo@@ di@@ fied for the army , both in terms of their man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ rability and their safety .
however , Pro@@ w@@ ler is totally different in terms of its nature and number 8 , as it were from the structure to the external A@@ T@@ V@@ le .
it is faster , it is more flexible , it is more stable , and it is capable of both carrying and bearing greater difficulties than other similar vehicles .
for example , in the case of a conventional A@@ T@@ V , when a driver has to play with his body position continu@@ ously to maintain a vehicle balance and use both arms to man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re and bra@@ ke , the driving of Pro@@ wa@@ g would be more like driving a car called ™ .
however , at the end of the day , it makes no difference whether Pro@@ w@@ ler , G@@ ator , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or any other A@@ T@@ V or U@@ T@@ V - and all of them have similar uses .
and it is clear that , where protection costs are broad@@ ly reduced , rather than the wider conventional war , by the little bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , tar@@ g@@ eting suspended at the target , Mr S@@ wa@@ it@@ ress , there are li@@ ght@@ weight and little vehicles with the army in order to remain in service .
my watch died , but I didn 't die , the act of Ra@@ iv@@ o E@@ . o@@ ak I@@ ron@@ man in the 7@@ 0.3 finish finish finish line .
true , in the whole half-@@ long tri@@ a@@ th@@ lon , the s@@ kin@@ ny didn 't even tend to leave R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t .
what is more , running 2@@ 1,@@ 1 8 , he got caught up in a conver@@ sa@@ tions : ' cause I was talking to a man while I was drinking , and a man ran by a man and sa@@ bo@@ taged : last I@@ ss@@ and , you got a little bit of talk !
in the running distance , Ra@@ iv@@ o , who had energy to tell , some of them are going to cross over to speed wal@@ ks .
on T@@ re@@ en@@ er 's recommendation .
Ms A@@ in-@@ AL@@ A@@ R Pre@@ sen@@ ts said that the moun@@ tains can walk , that there is no point in wa@@ ving , because there are such increases here , and there is little difference between yo@@ ks or spe@@ ed@@ y wal@@ ks , and the perpe@@ tra@@ tor says that he has heard the ad@@ visory words of the tri@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ te leader .
it was also able to draw sou@@ ls at the time of the cur@@ ve and , as a result , after crossing the finish line , it was capable of breathing on the left and on the right inter@@ views by José .
it 's like there 's no sw@@ im@@ ming 1.@@ 9 L@@ ights behind her back , 90 Hin@@ di b@@ ik@@ ed , and 2@@ 1,@@ 1 L@@ i de R@@ un .
I think maybe my exercise is also the way I get to start this competition with last January 's exercise and , to date , my body weight is 16 kil@@ ome@@ ters in the Ra@@ iv@@ o Plus tub@@ es that have lost 6@@ ,000 pounds .
and as far as the inter@@ views are concerned , it was my wish that I could give inter@@ views after the finish line .
I 've been able to give inter@@ views after every competition , and I was hoping it 'd be nice to be able to do it after O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä I@@ ron@@ man .
I thought it would be all right if I was not on the west side of I@@ ron@@ man : contrary to the swee@@ ping western land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , Ra@@ iv@@ o offered a whole other picture when crossing the fin@@ i@@ tes : hands with vi@@ c@@ tori@@ ous touch of Tara and the sincere joy of victory .
there was also a reason : R@@ ai@@ vo@@ l took 1.@@ 9 to swim with 46 minutes and 24 seconds , 90 to three hours and 32 minutes and 2@@ 1,@@ 1 to run with 2 hours and 18 minutes .
my heart has now been given to the tri@@ a@@ th@@ lon , Ra@@ iv@@ o , who has already been calling in the fin@@ i@@ us , that he gave the sport a si@@ p , and that took the si@@ eve .
I 've already registered myself on a bike from T@@ all@@ ina to Tar@@ tu on the 20th 7@@ th Gra@@ n Fon@@ do !
so tomorrow 's the tr@@ en@@ ni again !
the Thir@@ d F@@ esti@@ val Day of We@@ ek@@ end is accompanied by a strong wind .
that 's how one of the ima@@ ges of the N@@ ight F@@ ire was left in front of the camera , the ec@@ ho@@ es who were trying to fly in the wind .
as a result of the weather , many f@@ esti@@ vals , too , say that their mou@@ ths and eyes are filled with sand .
I think we 've done quite well .
we have done a good job and we have done good with our Me@@ n , And@@ res S@@ man@@ eri , the Re@@ veren@@ d Police Director , says how the first two days of We@@ ek@@ end have worked out for them .
S@@ man@@ eri says that today there are pat@@ rul@@ let people and high-@@ speed respon@@ ders , and they also intera@@ ct with people - perhaps they have questions and they also want to know how to become a high-@@ speed reac@@ tor .
within two days , the police have had to deal with some f@@ ights and drugs .
there have also been some handling of a large amount of nar@@ co@@ tic material , but we will summar@@ ise when We@@ ek@@ end is over with mbH , S@@ man@@ eri will say .
about a hundred people have been through the B@@ loo@@ dy Police Department in the last two days .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the police didn 't have to solve the ec@@ strike cases .
by the way , S@@ man@@ eri says that if there is a clou@@ d of rain from the sky and from S@@ wa@@ gen , they will not have a lot of work .
a Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u police field leader has once said that the rain is like an extra roll .
the B@@ lun@@ t police have also done a headquarters in the We@@ ek@@ end area , where you can take the things you found , and then you can claim your lost things .
by the way , the police even lost one of their necessary vi@@ ctor@@ ies with good people inven@@ ting Po@@ int I@@ ts .
look at the video that And@@ res S@@ man@@ no 's N@@ ight F@@ ire told you about .
the We@@ ek@@ end f@@ esti@@ val Bal@@ ti@@ c@@ u b@@ os@@ s G@@ un@@ na@@ r Vi@@ ese talks about the E@@ ight F@@ ire that the f@@ esti@@ val began years ago with So@@ om@@ est and its Ar@@ k de de la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
G@@ un@@ na@@ r says they have set themselves a target of 25 000 vis@@ itors a day , but chic@@ ks will only be coun@@ ted when the f@@ esti@@ val is over .
preparations for this year 's party started last year .
we had information from the city that the construction started in the last square , that there would be Ho@@ tel@@ l mbH , that G@@ un@@ na@@ r would tell us what kind of change they had to face .
for the time being , no K@@ op@@ pa can be seen there , but the idea is that if K@@ O@@ P@@ P didn 't go down on Earth , the next one will be .
so maybe we should have moved out of there some@@ time and explained why the F@@ esti@@ val area had moved .
the F@@ esti@@ val Or@@ der goes through them all year .
people work between a thousand and a half thousand in We@@ ek@@ ü@@ s - O@@ thers , com@@ mand@@ ers , Oly@@ mp@@ ics , Fe@@ lic@@ ity , Su@@ pre@@ me Association , and so on .
the har@@ dest part was , according to F@@ ive , to represent We@@ ek@@ ts to get a du@@ ot at T@@ he C@@ ha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ kers .
after all , men are now the number of the Po@@ p M@@ oun@@ tain Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships .
why T@@ he C@@ ha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ kers were hard to get We@@ ek@@ te , and how G@@ un@@ na@@ r commen@@ ts that two of his com@@ ra@@ des were cancel@@ led , look at the video .
from the west , there will be flas@@ h clou@@ ds in Estonia .
in the north of Estonia , there have already been reports of th@@ under@@ ing and seeing the flas@@ hes .
this afternoon , the weather service also issued a li@@ ght@@ ning warning .
today , it is mainly in North Estonia that there are many places of th@@ under .
li@@ ght@@ ning clou@@ ds move quickly from the west to the east .
there are out@@ breaks of the sou@@ th-@@ west west on Earth up to 15 , on the islands , and on the ' 18 m / s ' , but the li@@ ght@@ ning may be accompanied by ~ win@@ ds , there is a chain of the weather service called ' .
yet last night 's storm of li@@ ght@@ ning on Earth lies in the east of ~ ~ and in Russia from St Peter@@ s@@ burg .
fortunately , however , in Estonia , the win@@ ds are b@@ lowing from the West and from the West , so at least for the first time there is no risk of major stor@@ ms turning to Estonia .
the Fin@@ ns set up a dance party for their men .
when the first male dance party was held in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ res 11 years ago , the Or@@ der would probably not have drea@@ med of seeing the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans setting an example from a small Est@@ onian town .
today , however , the first Fin@@ nish men 's dance party is being held in the La@@ pu@@ a .
the representatives of the town of La@@ pu@@ a were so impres@@ sed by the last dance party of men in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ re , to organise something like that himself , by the head of R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e , the head of Ab@@ bo@@ t K@@ ai@@ ri , Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
this is what is happening today in the La@@ pu@@ a pes@@ ap@@ al@@ lis@@ ta@@ on@@ il of Finland , within the 100 celebra@@ tions , 2 shows of the Mi@@ es@@ -@@ Ti@@ mes si@@ pi@@ do , where 100 men from V@@ ir@@ u@@ land , i.e. Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
according to Pi@@ h@@ la@@ ku , this is an excellent example between two tw@@ ins of friendship .
it is also a celebra@@ tion of the Je@@ wish years of the re@@ public@@ s of Estonia and Finland .
there 's a hundred dan@@ cers with a mis@@ sile in the ' 69 top of the season in Kar@@ l Re@@ in@@ ku@@ b@@ jas .
I@@ -I@@ -I have the honour of being one of the 100 men who , in their breath , show what the men of V@@ ir@@ u are capable of , say .
the men dancing at I@@ ak@@ ver@@ e have put all their lea@@ gues in order when the Fin@@ nish men were preparing for the dance party , to show the level at the Nor@@ th@@ men , and A@@ in S@@ ur@@ ning , a member of the R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e munic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity , commen@@ ted on the case .
the performance of the V@@ ir@@ u@@ ma@@ an men has been com@@ mu@@ ted by the ar@@ tisti@@ c leader of the tan@@ tsu@@ an@@ sam@@ bel Tar@@ van@@ pä@@ ä with the poison of Tibet , with the reno@@ w@@ ned head of the Co@@ ast , E@@ lo Over@@ lord .
the Est@@ onian co@@ reg@@ ra@@ ia is based on a privi@@ leged hat@@ ch@@ ery .
the first Est@@ onian men 's dance party was organised in 2006 , and so far the last one was in July in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ res .
although the attention of the media is mainly towards the B@@ lun@@ t and the We@@ ek@@ end there , it is not the only mus@@ ical fund this weekend .
also , at the In@@ telli@@ gence F@@ esti@@ val on the Be@@ er M@@ use@@ um , there are M@@ ini@@ on F@@ än@@ s .
one of them wri@@ tes in T@@ wit@@ ter , for example : I sold We@@ ek@@ end 's ticket so I could go to the In@@ qu@@ iry .
and why not ?
in addition to the domestic Ms , there are also the perfor@@ man@@ ces from Me@@ ade , So@@ om@@ est , Le@@ ed@@ us , mbH , England and elsewhere .
the f@@ esti@@ val organi@@ zed in the magic forest also sur@@ prises ar@@ tis@@ ts present there because of the mag@@ ical location .
one of them , Lu@@ c@@ y Ro@@ se , was unable to get rid of T@@ wit@@ ter today how beautiful Estonia is .
however , the vis@@ itors have not been the go@@ ats of the great ad@@ ven@@ tures old old at last .
to be part of the In@@ telli@@ gence F@@ esti@@ val by yourself , look at the g@@ alle@@ ries !
even though the weekend has arrived , your actions are not kept silent .
you 're still full of work with your hands and feet , trying to get other people to act fast .
you could forget your concerns and ban@@ g off off off off off with your sleep .
take some time for yourself to join each other in a co@@ zy , ro@@ man@@ tic place .
talking about a burning subject , you burn the clo@@ sest ones , you make big plans , maybe you 'll give me a little something you 'll forget about a moment later .
the other party re@@ members your words .
being a Cy@@ cl@@ ops is a little une@@ as@@ y , and it 's hard to focus on something .
your sense of self may not depend on what is happening right now , but on things that have happened before .
you will also be able to act swi@@ f@@ tly and sensi@@ bly when you get into the situation in D@@ u .
it 's possible you 're getting out of somebody 's mind today because you have the wis@@ dom and the spirit .
you 'd better stop worrying about money and business .
take some time to blow and break .
a large crowd of events can be ti@@ res@@ ome and have a little bit of ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .
it is possible that you will find yourself in a situation where you will find yourself in a serious dispute , in which you will have to defend your views vigor@@ ously .
if the others cross the border , don 't do it .
you 'll feel better in a custom@@ ary environment , doing the things you know and do the things you enjoy .
you 're probably not thir@@ s@@ ty for new knowledge and ad@@ ven@@ tures right now .
being blo@@ wn up is an activity that I don 't think you 'll ever get your appetite full of .
today , too , you 're getting company .
what 's going on at the party may not be J@@ ell@@ -@@ O .
it may be that , despite a day off , you still have to deal with the th@@ under@@ bol@@ ts .
or maybe maybe maybe they 're physi@@ cally at home , but they 're still thinking at the desk .
if you want sharp last night , it can be offered by last night .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of ad@@ ven@@ tures will take you in , you 'll have to pull yourself together to stay on the wa@@ ves and keep your balance .
don 't waste your energy on the money stuff ... on j@@ oh@@ n .
take up this issue only if the situation really requires swi@@ ft intervention and intervention by Mr S@@ wa@@ mp .
in Indonesia , a man was burned alive , stealing three sounds powerful from a mo@@ s@@ que , a wa@@ ke@@ -up Hungarian news agency M@@ T@@ I .
a 30@@ -@@ year-old th@@ ief s@@ nu@@ ck out with a s@@ oun@@ ding power from the Be@@ kas@@ i city mo@@ s@@ que near J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 1st ll , but the hol@@ y wi@@ z@@ ard spo@@ tted him and sh@@ ou@@ ted : " sei@@ ze the th@@ ief ! "
I did , and they started ch@@ asing a th@@ ief .
he escaped on a motor@@ cycle and even sw@@ ung across the river .
the ch@@ ase las@@ ted a couple of L@@ ik@@ ers , then one of the guys who threw the stone in the back of the head , causing a serious injury .
the fi@@ er@@ cel@@ y ch@@ ase was caught by a th@@ ief and beat him up .
one of the ch@@ asing drivers , the th@@ ief , took a gas@@ oline , and set him on fire .
the inno@@ c@@ ence died of burning w@@ ounds over 7@@ b .
the body was taken to East J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Police H@@ os@@ pi@@ tal .
the police took in their possession both a dead motor@@ cycle and a stolen ring power .
at the ou@@ tset , the messages appeared , as if it were not a th@@ ief , but rather an electric mon@@ as@@ tery who said he wanted to re@@ new the ring@@ ers .
the police dis@@ man@@ tled them , however , at the time of last .
the in@@ he@@ rent in@@ mates of the S@@ ur@@ k@@ ha@@ i announced that they would not do the last thing on behalf of last night 's business .
according to the German news agency D@@ P@@ A , this step is due to the fact that the ind@@ on@@ es@@ tes do not trust the police or the judicial authorities very much .

Est@@ onian children 's ri@@ pp@@ les are affected by multi@@ ph@@ les .
while in Europe and 8 children are often shaped by what is being carried by the art or by the children of cele@@ bri@@ ties , Est@@ onian parents , on the basis of what is happening on the c@@ ine@@ ma .
British little pr@@ in@@ ts from Ge@@ or@@ gi is a genuine fashion gu@@ ru , following the example of a mother called H@@ er@@ t@@ so@@ g@@ in@@ na C@@ ah@@ ter@@ ine mbH .
just like his mother , the pr@@ inc@@ t can un@@ le@@ ash a real shopping ma@@ dness in people with its ri@@ pp@@ les , which has even become a concept in its own right , the effect of Mrs George J@@ ä@@ i .
the latest of this kind took place a few weeks ago in a visit by the art family to Poland , where George carried the ten euro@@ s of the Spanish br@@ andy in Ti@@ z@@ za , a blue and red bar , which were bought by the mad parents at the e-@@ shop by 24 hours .
obviously , there was not much of them for shopping shopping from Estonia , because the late children of the ro@@ y@@ alty , I@@ ike , alle@@ ge@@ dly our parents would be completely cold .
Anna An@@ s@@ mit@@ t , the head of Trade Time , recognises that the children of the star cou@@ p@@ les and the foreign mo@@ et@@ ry in general do not affect our parents ' purcha@@ ses to their model children .
in Estonia , the purchase of children 's affairs is directed by the fo@@ ils , the car@@ to@@ ons and also the Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be S@@ wa@@ b channels .
so the fin@@ est products of the last few years are the wrec@@ kage , the multi-@@ fac@@ e@@ ted games with the charac@@ ters of F@@ ro@@ zen Te , dol@@ ls , clo@@ ths , dancing dogs or cats , hat@@ ching pen@@ gu@@ ins , and so on to bed .
at the same time , it confir@@ ms that , if it so wishes , Estonia will also be able to dress its children in the same way as Europe 's pr@@ inc@@ es or pr@@ inc@@ es .
the man ho@@ stages with the model plan to sell him in a nu@@ mb .
a Polish citizen took a British model ho@@ stage in Italy .
the guy was planning to put a 20-@@ year-old woman at a tu@@ me@@ le@@ e , maybe an au@@ ction for en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted eight , announced by Guy .
according to the police , a woman was fla@@ tte@@ red to M@@ ila@@ n by July 11 with a promise that she would get a job at a photogra@@ p@@ her .

the mother was sent an e@@ pos@@ ted ta@@ bel , which , in the cities of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia , las@@ ts and places of particular concern and attention for all children living in the V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia city .
the e@@ mail revealed the place where every child lives .
the list states that one 13@@ -@@ year-old boy has been released for ba@@ il and that there is behavi@@ or with regard to him that there is a 15-@@ year-old girl who has problems with self-@@ harm , with certain substances , with drinks and running off , is at least 8 : 00 , and that one 14-@@ year-old boy needs help with her bloody care and is aggres@@ sively aggressive and threatening .
the ta@@ bel seems to be a transfer document designed to be sent to the night shift com@@ mander .
the document shall contain records of when a child can be expected home , or whether they can contact their staff to catch up .
a worrying number of details have been provided for some children .
in the case of a 15-@@ year-old boy , it is written in a warning : if staff contact to obtain permission to search the room and / or to obtain permission to use the s@@ lap@@ per / U@@ S@@ B device because of the suspic@@ ion of inappropriate sexual material , that authorisation should be granted in the case of HR@@ T .
the document also states that for a 17@@ -@@ year-old girl who will be 18 in just three months ' time and will be released from the institution of S@@ EA , the risk of a suicide attempt is so high that , in the event of her escape , the staff will have to be generous to the emergency line as soon as possible .
the 16@@ -@@ year-old condition for the released boy was stated that he was out and would contact staff later to catch up with him .
however , although only the name of the 8,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ unit where children are kept and not their no@@ bles has been mentioned for these lo@@ cations , there are still enough details to be found .
the data lea@@ k of last year emer@@ ged when the mother shared her experience with F@@ a@@ ir@@ fa@@ x last year with F@@ a@@ ir@@ fax last year 's personal contact with services and with child protection since she was taken into the care of her daughter four years ago .
he accepted his concerns now that his ty@@ rant had become 18 and left the system .
the heart@@ felt decision to hand over her daughter to child protection was obtained after a violent incident at home , and this case is one of an increasing number of fa@@ mil@@ y-@@ related complaints made by parents against their children .
it had consequences that the mother would never have imag@@ ined , such as obtaining seven criminal prosecu@@ tions within six months of leaving the home , moving to the dis@@ tant home and habi@@ tat of last night 's old Ti@@ ts , where she seemed to be successful , but then moved back without infor@@ ming her parents , along with with with wa@@ king up the relationship between her daughter and her el@@ der .
the relationship with the first of those boy@@ friends , 17 years of age , with whom the authorities allowed a woman at the time of the 15-@@ year-old ty@@ re at that time at a regular time in a hotel called 8 , ended when the young person , a few days after being given 18 years of age , was accused of having sex with a child .
why did he get out of the system in a worse situation than when he came in ?
so will this happen to all the ca@@ rele@@ ss children ?
he vo@@ ic@@ ed the creation of an institution which would enable the children of the Ministry of Services to be monitored with a voice during the last few days after they were taken into custody before they were moved to their homes .
this would enable them to understand better how children are communic@@ ating with others and what the risks and the dangers they pose , especially in an educational way .
the government will be looking for new ways of reducing the need for children to be placed at home in L@@ es , involving better support for their parents , among other things .
the aim of targeted subsidies , which will be worth $ 62 million over four years , is to help transfer children from home to home with better organisation situations .
in addition , the $ 5.@@ 6 million in a two-@@ year period , however , published by the previous d@@ é@@ ber , allows professional care@@ rs to be offered to at least 28 children to help them with or prevent them from being drawn from S@@ wa@@ b .
according to a member of the department , communications were not officially reported when this happened , although the mother claims that she informed the two departments at the time of a few months after last last d@@ red@@ ged in ' .
the department is now working together to analyse the case .
every alleged sp@@ ill of private data is being taken very seriously , and we are working to ensure that it has not affected the young people concerned by last night .
last year 's last year 's Lab@@ our and Chil@@ d@@ ren 's Minister , J@@ enn@@ y M@@ olly , ordered an independent review of Chil@@ d@@ ren 's privacy over a five-@@ year period .
the department has accepted the seven recommendations made as a result and has since renewed the Chil@@ d Protection Gu@@ ide to ensure that staff clearly under@@ stands their role and the procedures relating to privacy , has changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic poo@@ ling of certain personal data , and has officially reviewed the services relating to the privacy of the department .

C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge 's H@@ er@@ t@@ so@@ g@@ in@@ na 's dead@@ ly child@@ hood friend should have been allowed to end her life , according to her mother .

a 3@@ 4-@@ year-old child 's cer@@ ra@@ al@@ par@@ al@@ ysis was diagnosed as a brain cas@@ tor in 2014 , but , according to his mother , he suffered horri@@ bly before he died in May .
Chris@@ tine E@@ ele@@ y , 65 , from Ne@@ w@@ bury , Ber@@ x , has called for a change in the law that would enable those suffering from a dead@@ ly disease and those suffering from mental illness to control the way in which they died and the way in which they could control their death .
he said that the death of his daughter was tor@@ mented by death in him by last last night 's severe trauma , and by last but not least , that the law would have allowed him to put in place a plan that would be a dig@@ ni@@ fied death for his daughter if his condition deterior@@ ated .
the English author shall publish the book in retro@@ spe@@ ct .
last time I checked , Mic@@ ha@@ els , the former ed@@ itor of the B@@ B@@ C , and the mother of two children , was the first book he wrote to the press at the time of Ju@@ dge T@@ at@@ ler .
the book took three years , and this is the fi@@ br@@ ant Ab@@ bo@@ t to Mar@@ ic@@ on E@@ spi@@ ri@@ tu and G@@ in@@ al@@ y@@ n N@@ ara@@ gi , who help coo@@ king and the son , the F@@ our@@ th Y@@ ears of Jo@@ sep@@ h , and the ty@@ re , the two-@@ year-old F@@ l@@ or@@ en@@ ce .

a Hel@@ ping H@@ and Te is available in boo@@ k@@ sh@@ ops all over last resor@@ t at 3@@ 9.@@ 90 S@@ G@@ D and also at Hit@@ n abroad , including in H@@ ong@@ kon@@ g , Du@@ ba@@ is , in Du@@ ba@@ is , in last year and in last year 's mise@@ ry .
E@@ lise Chris@@ ti@@ e is talking about how she got over the S@@ ot@@ t@@ las hor@@ rors and last night 's S@@ ot@@ t@@ wa@@ g , to s@@ kate again for the gold .
compared to that ha@@ p@@ ra acti@@ n who recently weig@@ hed himself with a ska@@ ting en@@ vel@@ ope for bo@@ re@@ dom , a 2@@ 6-@@ year-old Chris@@ ti@@ e has become unknown .
the mean insu@@ lts kno@@ cked his feet off , especially because he was also temp@@ ted when he was a kid at W@@ est Lo@@ th@@ ia .
at the moment , he is ob@@ sessed with self-@@ confidence and believes that the circle can return to the starting point , with at least one gold in P@@ î@@ n ong@@ ch@@ ang .
of course , as an Olympic winner , I would like to say , ' No , no , no , no , no , no , no . '
I feel that I am both physi@@ cally and mentally in the right place to deal with this in the past .
he used to dream of a figure ska@@ ting career until the a@@ esthe@@ tic guys , uh , began to lower that interest .
I was a very good ju@@ m@@ per , but I had trouble with the ar@@ tisti@@ c side of the deal with Jos@@ é@@ p@@ é , he said by laughing .
I wasn 't very good at e@@ leg@@ ality , proper .
it was a sensible choice , because shor@@ t- building ska@@ ting is best sui@@ ted to my person@@ ality .
Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m last night recogni@@ zes the last two days because of the kidna@@ pping charge by Germany .
Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m said on Thursday that he knew u@@ th about the German External Action Service , which ac@@ cu@@ ses the former Vic@@ et@@ de@@ z oil company , who is wanted at home because of ownership charges , by the perpe@@ tra@@ tors of the last last last last last year , called " Fe@@ lic@@ ity " .
Germany L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise believes that T@@ rin@@ h X@@ u@@ an T@@ han@@ h has been gra@@ bbed from Ber@@ d@@ í@@ s , which left last 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country .
T@@ han@@ h is faced with pos@@ sessi@@ ve acc@@ us@@ ations , which are associated with last resor@@ t to last few hours .
he was sear@@ ching for the az@@ yl of last night 's life , but his last name was not to go through last night 's work when he was extra@@ di@@ ted by last night .
the external representative , Le T@@ hi Th@@ u Han@@ g , said to the re@@ por@@ ters that the last last few days were last long and that T@@ han@@ h turned himself in to the police on 31 July .
Ms Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m always atta@@ ches importance to and wants to develop relations with Germany - she said details without going into detail .
T@@ han@@ h , 51 , last year 's Day disappeared after he was initially charged with leadership at a ty@@ rant in the state and ga@@ a@@ si@@ g@@ ig@@ and Pet@@ ro@@ last year , which brought with him about USD 150 million in the amount of CYP2C8 .
last time I checked , the police issued an arrest warrant for the last two weeks .
in March , police investigations were conducted to investigate the acquisition of his alleged ob@@ sessi@@ ve activities .
T@@ han@@ h was the chairman of Mr Pet@@ ro@@ Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m Con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ti@@ on Jo@@ in@@ t S@@ to@@ ck Corporation until 2013 , when he was chairman of Mr S@@ to@@ ck Corporation 's senior president in the South Me@@ kon@@ g del@@ ta , including the vi@@ ce-@@ chairman of the provin@@ ce of Ha@@ u Gi@@ last .
he was released at the National Assembly in May 6 , but Commun@@ ist Wil@@ d was overwhel@@ ming@@ ly released from the legislative body before the first month of last last .
he was also expe@@ lled from the Commun@@ ist Party .
the Second Amb@@ assa@@ dor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany and he was informed that Germany was calling for the return of T@@ han@@ h , so that the asylum and extra@@ dition procedures could be carried out by J@@ ä@@ i .
the results of the investigation show that the cock@@ ro@@ aches also spread seeds .
like birds and J@@ ell@@ y@@ ans , the cock@@ ro@@ aches spread seeds .
these pu@@ ppe@@ ts are known mainly as la@@ g@@ oon@@ s who help to dis@@ man@@ tle the ro@@ tting substances under@@ ne@@ ath the forest .
but the P@@ rus@@ sa@@ ks also help to spread the seeds .
Japan L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise discovered that cock@@ ro@@ aches play an important role in distribu@@ ting seeds to the wild species , Mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ trum .
this is an unusual plant .
it does not contain the ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ ph@@ yl , which is why it is not capable of photo@@ synthesis .
instead , the species becomes its own support heat from the growing mus@@ h@@ rooms bene@@ ath the ground ground .
T@@ ai@@ m s@@ kul@@ ls the woods with tiny , sc@@ is@@ sors and little white guys .
the fruit has very little or no taste , and the Japanese scientists found that the species of birds and 6@@ 8 are not interested in them as food .
only a hand@@ ful of Jos@@ é@@ n@@ u is ar@@ able meat and forest pr@@ us@@ sa@@ kas B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p@@ pon@@ ica was the only species that would regularly last .
the investi@@ g@@ ators checked out the cock@@ ro@@ ach field to determine whether these pu@@ ppi@@ es help the seeds of the plant .
on average three so@@ aps were found to be eliminated after eating each crop .
last week I checked , the last time I checked , the last time I checked , the last time I checked , the last time I checked , the last thing I saw was last night .
it is presu@@ med that this Mi@@ le@@ an plant eli@@ te is likely to have lear@@ nt the ability of cock@@ ro@@ ach seeds , at the time of the event .
the fru@@ its of the plant hang near the ground city and they 're ready at the same time as the cock@@ ro@@ aches emer@@ ge from their l@@ arva@@ e sta@@ dium .
the investi@@ g@@ ators will present their findings this week in B@@ ot@@ an@@ ical Journal of the L@@ in@@ ne@@ an So@@ ci@@ ety .
given that some 4@@ 600 pr@@ us@@ sa@@ k@@ ali@@ ks have been identified so far , the distribution of seeds through the cock@@ ro@@ aches can be much more extensive and , so far , simply docu@@ mentary mechanisms , not just the ability of a particular plant eli@@ te , Mr S@@ wa@@ b , to explo@@ it the cock@@ ro@@ aches , said in the press release Na@@ o@@ to Su@@ gi@@ ur@@ a , a co-@@ professor of the Uni@@ versity of K@@ um@@ am@@ o@@ to .
~ They say that dis@@ closed findings ~ pay more attention to the vari@@ ables of plants and cock@@ ro@@ aches ~ and seek further to see how the cock@@ ro@@ ach seeds are spread by ~ .
