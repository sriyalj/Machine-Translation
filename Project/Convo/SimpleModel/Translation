is it the solution , at last , to avoid the type of money ?
for Mr R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , it is often a timing of time .
his S@@ port C@@ it@@ y Pi@@ z@@ za Putin is based on the S@@ port C@@ it@@ y P@@ z@@ za P@@ u@@ b will depend on the fact that cli@@ ents are b@@ lin@@ ded and outs@@ our@@ ced . , C@@ on@@ t and sh@@ ell@@ t and sh@@ ell@@ s .
however , it is an automatic message that we are trying to push through fraud .

aid is on the road , albeit slowly .
over the last year , the government &apos;s support for mobile phones has been incorporated into the new tools of the government that has been added to mobile phones .
F@@ ed@@ er@@ al Com@@ mis@@ si@@ tion has proposed to enable telephone companies to block the more j@@ un@@ k speeches and hopes to bur@@ y . the petitions with large fines .
according to experts , these steps are not a final solution , but they are a good start .
the f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist and non-@@ sensitive authorisation authorisation should protect people from un@@ wanted calls from remote distributors .
however , fra@@ ud@@ sters are not interested in breaking the law .
fra@@ ud@@ sters reach people on the cheap and simple way , using &apos; automatic voters &apos; , which will automatically make a lot of speaking .
it is estimated that the Americans will receive tens of millions of Roma people a day .
all of these are , of course , not de@@ ception .
pharma@@ cies are , for example , automa@@ ted messages on the application of prescri@@ ptions .
but all too often the situation is as follows : you have a debt to the tax office ; Mic@@ ro@@ soft is calling for a computer to be put in order ; it is free c@@ aste . it is !
in addition , the sub@@ prime pri@@ mers are using a complex technology , which shows the telephone number in the phone and an important figure , such as the tax authority .
the implementation of suitable measures for the figures for &apos; &apos; &apos; in numbers &apos; for figures , would exacerbate fraud and help to keep millions of dollars in the United States , as stated by some states . the group of Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor Group .
telephone companies and independent applications will be able to screening or block un@@ wanted speeches compared to these known problematic figures and analyses . children &apos;s behaviour , such as the number , which calls for a lot of people with non-@@ calls lists for many people .
mobile service providers are also a tool that add these warnings such as &apos; T@@ o@@ eye de@@ ception such as &apos; T@@ o@@ eye de@@ ception &apos; , but they do not . it is available to customers and for a large number of un@@ paid cards available to customers .
from V@@ er@@ z@@ on and S@@ prin@@ tion can be commission@@ ed for the su@@ per levy .
some And@@ ro@@ id@@ -@@ phone telephone , including Google &apos;s Pi@@ x@@ el , a screening of free speech .
the Mul@@ ti@@ -@@ media cen@@ sus J@@ en V@@ ar@@ banks ( 39 ) , said that he &apos;s A@@ S &amp; S &amp; Government will mark his application . and it is blocked by certain dis@@ orders on his mobile phone , but in the case of phone calls he has given up .
&apos;@@ I very rarely speak out of the figures I do not know &apos; said in War@@ saw .
applications such as Y@@ oun@@ il and N@@ om@@ et@@ b@@ o provide free of charge for domestic contracts , but the restrictions were rela@@ xed .
in the case of Y@@ oun@@ i@@ il , the operator must allow the &apos; conditional speech &apos; , which puts the speeches on the line when it is not up to the seat . that is the case .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available for all ten@@ ders available to parents , who are not employed by parents , by parents .
it is also possible to buy a few of them , some of them , which are being blocked by domestic telephone .
the V@@ er@@ z@@ on will also be tests on the number of warnings about the number of warnings on domestic telephone numbers .
telephone companies are already able to block certain speeches , which are fraudulent .
F@@ c@@ c has proposed rules for the form@@ alisation of such practices and for the removal of the speeches made by other fraud .
this means that the V@@ er@@ z@@ on may be blocked by the cost of the charge , which takes the charge of payment , but it will never be one .
it would also be possible to block the speeches on which they know that they are not legitimate , such as 9@@ 11 guidelines .
these rules need to be fin@@ e-@@ tu@@ ned .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ hy@@ on@@ e@@ y , the public order to the consumer of consumers , said that these developments are &apos; encouraging &apos; hope &apos; . &apos;@@ but not protection consumers from all un@@ wanted speeches .
firstly , there is no waiting lists for certain types of organisations , such as creditors and political campaigns .
in addition , the report would cover only counterfeit figures , according to Ma@@ h@@ on@@ ic , would only cover the counterfeit figures .
all the Roma are not meant to be nothing .
the consumer of consumers wants telephone companies to do the tools of the telephone cor@@ ners to be made available to all consumers .
in the longer term , Euro@@ c@@ c industry supports the efforts to confirm that the gene@@ der is indeed the one that he claims to be .
perhaps one day , we can see a &apos; smart telephone &apos; on one day , when a mag@@ is@@ er is legitimate .
the T@@ ele@@ r@@ com lob@@ bies from U@@ .@@ S@@ . T@@ ele@@ com says that it can be used for several years , but it would be a ro@@ bo@@ h . it is a powerful tool against the perpetrators .
F@@ c@@ c is also looking for ways to put an end to the usual speeches to consumers who exchange the figure .
if you were registered in a non-@@ call list , but to obtain a new figure later on , the distribu@@ tor and may be re@@ medi@@ ed in the new line . let us start .
&apos;@@ R@@ ob@@ o@@ th@@ el@@ ers will not go away &apos; , A@@ ar@@ re N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bo@@ s , which is mobile and home . the service of the telephone calls for phone calls .
&apos;@@ they are criminal and find a new way to by@@ pass any system .
however , our work is to do this as difficult as possible for them .
there are a number of logical measures that consumers should implement .
do not answer the phone , if you do not know the numbers .
yes , this is not , unfortunately , a practical way of business , such as S@@ port C@@ it@@ y .
inter@@ rupt un@@ wanted speeches .
do not say &apos; no &apos; , and do not press any bu@@ tton .
when you deal with them , they may be able to mention you , who will respond and bur@@ y to more speeches .
where possible , the figure is blocked after the speech .
use the application of the speeches .
if you have any concerns about privacy , control the rules of application , to see whether it shares your speeches or contact with distributors .
do not make calls for calls on personal data , such as bank account or social security .

however , when four days of work and three rest days are concerned , this is a forced solution for the four hours of work and three rest days , then this will be a more bureaucratic solution .
the 1.5 hours that has been taken for 1.5 hours , has been taken with family and ho@@ bi@@ or water , instead of reco@@ vering . irri@@ gation and anxi@@ ety , and the abolition of the work of the work .
how do we finance company vehicles ?
in consumer society , alongside the background of the background of the industrial society , alongside the background of the background , there is an increasing number of companies in the full services of businesses , or instead of a compulsory fre@@ er . the long-term author .
the mo@@ therhood and the ren@@ ti@@ fication of the vehicle is two clearly different financial transactions , which include different responsibilities and expectations , but which often cause confusion .
in the context of the International car &apos;s company was the company of the sale and marketing leader in Vil@@ o@@ v T@@ ur@@ d , are seen to see that companies are increasingly moving in the direction of a full service company . the possibility of long-term ren@@ tability is also being used .
the T@@ EC brought out the main issues which , in the search for answers , can choose the way in which we find answers .
how long do it ?
the greatest difference is the time for which the car is mo@@ cking and the time is used .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is worth giving priority to the need for a longer period of a long@@ er@@ -term vehicle , if business has a plan to introduce commercial vehicles for a period of longer term &apos; . the addition , by adding that it is worth deciding if a vehicle is to be in place if a vehicle is to have a full service company or a long-term cycle if the vehicle is to be made . to use a car on a daily basis , but while not giving care to the service provider , and by ren@@ oun@@ cing them .
&apos;@@ R@@ es@@ cars has a much shorter period of operation , but many of the larger car companies also offer a long-term car , where the car ren@@ ti@@ fication of the car . there is no room for complicated contractual and free re@@ fund &apos; , presented the different ways of re@@ working a car .
who will become a vehicle &apos;s ow@@ ner ?
at the end of the T@@ ex@@ i@@ d@@ ry is the ow@@ ner of the car .
in the case of &apos; thank you in the case of the li@@ am@@ ation period , it will be possible to continue with the same or better terms , the equivalent of the replacement of the same place . a new vehicle which responds to the needs of the company , he , emphasising that , as the consumer society is increasingly heading in the service of services , is increasingly heading for the average consumption of services , then the vehicle &apos;s own is an additional responsibility for business .
in addition , there is an opportunity to buy a car for the full services of services .
however , this opportunity is not , and it is only paid for the period of application .
the business of the car is generally happening in the representa@@ tions of the car companies and the ren@@ tability of the car company .
the representa@@ tions of the car companies are , first and foremost , a possibility of the company , and , in some cases , the author .
however , you have cars alone with the sole aim of excluding them .
it is a friend in the words that the reasons for the use of the temporary service are different - many companies are le@@ asing their vehicles , in addition the service is a service of comfor@@ t . either , or when their own car is in an amendment .
there is an increasing number of the transparency of vehicles for vehicles , which offers the transparency of the cost of vehicles in the purchase of vehicles - the use of vehicles . and greater comfor@@ t in the recovery process and greater comfor@@ t &apos; , presented the &apos; sales and marketing leader &apos; .
every year , more and more companies use their car fleet in every year , thereby optimis@@ ing its expenditure and by focusing on their core business .
what is the service coverage of the service ?
when a car is a compulsory ca@@ talo@@ gue of c@@ at and traffic insurance , the ren@@ di@@ er is covered by basic insurance , and it is also necessary to decide whether to take . to include , for example , an accident in the health insurance , security insurance or full insurance , &apos; if you compare the background to the full services of services , then the custom@@ er will be . however , there is more in six months because , in addition to the vehicles and insurance , the heating of cars will also be covered by the payment of cars for cars , from 24 days , tyres . exchanges and other agreed services &apos; , was explained by the T@@ EC .
&apos;@@ if a background to a background can take any new vehicle , then in the case of a full service company , the service and the company &apos;s wishes and needs a vehicle corresponding to the company &apos;s wishes and needs of a vehicle that meets their own wishes and needs . the functions of the use are also taken into account of the functions of the use of the use of the company in order to opti@@ mise the costs associated with the company &apos;s fleet .
however , the choice of &apos; R@@ end@@ ers &apos; , however , is dependent on the service of the service providers - the different le@@ vers offer their own fleet in their vehicle fleet . one for the use of urban traffic as well as a luxury for commercial courts &apos; , described the T@@ est .
in a den@@ sely populated period , of course , it may be possible that the desired car has already been ex@@ pelled , but it is against it .
there should first be clear our objectives for the long term , it should first be made clear to our objectives - how long is the desire to use the vehicle , and what is long-term plans for the car . that is the case .
it will certainly be worthwhile to examine the different conditions and obligations of services .
how a man built his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter USD 51 million .
one in T@@ ex@@ h@@ an discovered father found that there is not a single piece of items where he could be able to play .
it has therefore decided to build one .
Mr H@@ AR@@ T@@ N has just come out from the family holiday , when its 12-@@ year-old ty@@ rant Morgan was approached in other blood . for the children .
he tried to absor@@ b them , but they quickly left the b@@ ars .
the H@@ AR@@ T@@ N believes that they do not know how to treat the disabled , as they do not know how to treat disabled persons - M@@ ans have a five-year experience of this . a reason@@ ing approach , and also a form of certain au@@ tis@@ m .
this incident was bi@@ ased to ha@@ unt him .
&apos;@@ M@@ y is a young gir@@ l is a young gir@@ l .
his meeting with him will always lead to a lack of s@@ mi@@ le , and he will no doubt want to expand .
however , there have been many times where we have not received her in different places &apos; , he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ K@@ N and his wife Mag@@ gi@@ e asked from others to where they could lead their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter - wherever they might get their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter - wherever he may feel . in a comfortable way and others would also feel well in their dealings with him .
&apos;@@ We came to the conclusion that there is no such involvement in the H@@ AR@@ T@@ N .
it therefore decided to build it in 2007 .
a former property develop@@ er was sold back in 2005 in 2005 to set up the P@@ A@@ N F@@ am@@ il@@ y F@@ oun@@ il@@ y F@@ am@@ il@@ y F@@ am@@ il@@ y F@@ oun@@ il@@ y F@@ am@@ il@@ y F@@ ou@@ il@@ y F@@ am@@ il@@ y F@@ ou@@ il@@ y . now , there is a non-@@ profit group that helps people with disabilities .
he then started &apos; the creation of a &apos; world &apos;s first , most accessible topics of the world .
&apos;@@ We wanted to create a dossier where everything can do everything in which they can play with both needs and without special needs &apos; people &apos; , say H@@ AR@@ T@@ T . N .
he called on doctors , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ ts , parents and other people with disabilities and without disability , to consult the facility .
they were set in the family of 10 hectares in the San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ ex@@ as .
a par@@ k called the W@@ on@@ der@@ land cost USD 34 million ( EUR 26 million ) and was opened in 2010 .
this includes a fully accessible review of the playing field and min@@ i-@@ one .
visitors often say to Har@@ t@@ man@@ i often say that they were only able to experience such applications for the first time .
there is also a fear of a car@@ cas@@ ter which has a design translation for wh@@ eel@@ chairs , which are moving on the side and under the car@@ go .
however , H@@ AR@@ T@@ N , it is clear that Morgan was , at the beginning , be fe@@ ar@@ ful when it comes to a trip .
&apos;@@ when we opened it , he did not dare to go to it .
he did not understand why it is around and why the animals move and under the car@@ go , H@@ AR@@ T@@ N .
it took three years before the Morgan was in agreement with a car@@ ror .
&apos;@@ at the start , he was quite simply a close to it , it is not creating a war , but we did not have war .
it was a slow process , but now he likes to drive it .
overcoming something which was frigh@@ tened him , was a great deal for him .
the small things achieved in the game will make a difference &apos; .
since its opening , the Morgan of W@@ on@@ der@@ land is a member of the W@@ on@@ der@@ land , and of all 50 American countries .
a third of staff is disabled and entry is free to anyone who has a condition of disease .
&apos;@@ I understood that the Morgan is one of the happy things , because he has many things necessary for her .
I did not want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ N .
&apos;@@ L@@ open every year , knowing that we are at least one million dollars ( 750 000 GBP 750 000 ) , and we must put it back in the service of cor@@ ps and partners . &apos;@@ .
this year the subject of the report was extended to the opening of I@@ c@@ elan@@ dic , namely the opening of I@@ c@@ elan@@ dic .
&apos;@@ in July , there were fewer people who visited the wh@@ eel@@ chairs changed too much .
we have therefore chosen to set up a &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ K@@ N .
in some parts of the island , gender and water has been used to travel to meat problems .
we have a water@@ tight f@@ id@@ -@@ and-@@ whe@@ el that work with the air and not with bat@@ teri@@ es .

a total of 17 million dollars ( EUR 13 million ) .
&apos;@@ yesterday , a man came to me in Iceland , and I just kept my hand &apos; , is talking about H@@ AR@@ T@@ T .
&apos;@@ he referred to his son , who has serious special needs , and came to bu@@ t@@ ched .
he said he did not have the son to play &apos; in the past .
Mr Har@@ t@@ man says there are no three par@@ ks from every four visit to the population , is precisely what it was hoping for .
&apos;@@ this will help people understand that , although we are different in certain ways , we are actually exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;@@ I saw a wh@@ eel@@ chair in a wh@@ eel@@ chair went on to the second , without special needs , and they started to play together .
it was a really cra@@ zy &apos; .
Har@@ t@@ man@@ is no longer going to open up , even though he has obtained a pos@@ ter and hundreds of letters from people who would also like their own neighbours . that is what it is .
instead , he is focusing on the provision of educational facilities for young people in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ o .
&apos;@@ I know that there are many different organisations which are trying to build something in the Morgan of W@@ on@@ der@@ land , and we will continue to work with them &apos; . he .
he will continue to play a role in the Morgan - Morgan is now a kind of hearing .
&apos;@@ when he comes here , he is like a ro@@ ck !
many people want to talk to him and to do with him , he has to deal well with it &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ K@@ N .
the Morgan , which is now a 2@@ 3-@@ year-old , it will be better able to do things better .
&apos;@@ he now speaks more and most of its physical problems has been resolved through numerous operations .
we are so proud that he has reached so far .
if the Morgan par@@ k is going to visit him most in the stone and in the s@@ and s@@ and in the s@@ and in the s@@ and s@@ and .
&apos;@@ M@@ y knows that the par@@ k has become a name , but I do not believe that he understands what it actually represents , and how this is what it actually represents , and how it has changed lives &apos; . Mr H@@ AR@@ T@@ N has a say .
&apos;@@ he does not understand that the way it has managed to do things in life , has made it a real source of inspiration .

the business group is b@@ ind@@ ing the government to agree on the transitional conditions of the Bre@@ x@@ as .
one of the UK &apos;s largest group of business lob@@ bies is promp@@ ting the government to end the tan@@ ta@@ le of the Bre@@ x@@ is on the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery .
the In@@ no@@ tions of the &apos; transitional agreement &apos; in order to make progress with the Bre@@ x@@ is of the &apos; transitional agreement &apos; in order to make progress in the Bre@@ x@@ on . that is the case .
it is a desire for the government to establish a &apos; bridge between the &apos; Bre@@ x@@ on &apos; bridge between the EU and the establishment of new trade agreements .
a group warned that , without such an agreement , the short-term cha@@ otic fluctu@@ ating fluctu@@ ations in commercial activity &apos; .
they criticised the government &apos; transition to all possible speculative disputes in the field of speculative disputes .
in recent weeks , members of the government have tabled contradictory views on how long the transition period takes and what it entails .
the I@@ V@@ D report &apos; : &apos; the possibility of transition &apos; is written in the letter : &apos; instead of a far ha@@ bit of the problem , the government must create it . the subject of a strategic debate .
this could minimise the growing confusion and insecurity in this area .
Mr Ly@@ on , an economic scien@@ tist and the group E@@ con@@ om@@ is@@ ts on the motto of the Bre@@ x@@ on , described this week &apos; . the &apos; Bre@@ x@@ on &apos; Bre@@ x@@ on &apos; the &apos; pan@@ el of pan@@ ic@@ ards &apos; , which is re@@ minis@@ cent of fear of the M@@ 2@@ K C@@ RS .

Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ is@@ on , the I@@ D and the leader of trade policy , said : &apos; K@@ an@@ da@@ le@@ l , has the right to be concerned about the delay in business investments .
this is one of the most frequent changes to the relocation of the EU , one of the most frequent changes that must be dealt with in relation to the Bre@@ x@@ on .
the latter is particularly the case of the members of the I@@ D in Northern Ireland who are currently considering a common seat or the relocation &apos; .
the I@@ D offers a number of opportunities , including the following extension of Article 50 ( I@@ D ) .
accession to the European Economic Area
it is to remain within the remit of the European Union legislation .
the creation of a transitional customs agreement , like the customs union of the EU
Ren@@ is@@ on said : &apos; the I@@ D provided for the transition in connection with the transition , in the hope that it is an un@@ proper debate on the issue of how the best of the Bre@@ x@@ on is the best of the Bre@@ x@@ on . to finish it .
a priorit@@ isation of the interim orders and , therefore , eas@@ ing the risk of exit from the EU , means that short-term cha@@ otic fluctu@@ ations are not reduced . the possibilities for the future &apos; .

this is a mes@@ s of the mes@@ s of C@@ ric@@ k A@@ us@@ tr@@ ia ( ( ca ) The embarras@@ sing delays in achieving a wage agreement , the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an country ( understand ) the deciding team by the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an , the S@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an F@@ esti@@ val of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an independent , independent commission of an independent commission . in the case , and the in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence of the A@@ F@@ L ) to be the flag of social justice among the people .

Mrs David Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r is the former executive president of the Ri@@ o tin@@ y , the former executive President , and he asked for the latter to resort to the wage negotiations for the CAP . the driver and the advi@@ ser .
however , it would be mistaken to think that elite business@@ men , whose approach is un@@ te@@ na@@ ble in communic@@ ating with criminals , does not love this sport .
Mr Pe@@ e@@ ver was , for example , a regular visit of the S@@ G@@ P , until he was able to another country in the home .
in spite of this , strict negotiations between the ca and Ac@@ ta and extremely high wages have given the impression that A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an country &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite , is now more of business than the white of sport .
on the contrary , however , the role of an in@@ man@@ able leader , the former former Man@@ aging Director of C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , the failure of the C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , the inability of C@@ l@@ y@@ ne to the A@@ us@@ tr@@ is . the S@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ b@@ y team to the roots .

the R@@ ag@@ bi@@ le is dis@@ gus@@ ting that they have the most qualified and more diversi@@ fied Bureau , but far too far from international partners &apos; requirements in this respect , it is still far too much on sport in order to be a business .
both radic@@ als and football have problems with leadership , as the stakeholders are demanding more power .
both too chair@@ men , Mr G@@ ran@@ t Ar@@ t , Mr G@@ ran@@ t Ar@@ t , has shown that their business skills do not have their business skills . it has been enough to achieve corporate stability .
G@@ ran@@ a , former K@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o , a successful IT company , but it was 20 years out of the game .
it became a value when a newly created Ar@@ med Ar@@ med For@@ ce was needed .
too stakeholders , who did not trust each other , decided that no one who has been involved in the Commission &apos;s work , no one who has taken part in the last three years . apart from the passive phenomenon .
however , if you go too far , however , and too f@@ ans have been looking for a ba@@ il-@@ out of this time - someone who would have a name in sport . the past .

J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ is sp@@ ends around 300 000 dollars a year in order to keep their own body in play .
each play of the N@@ FL@@ -@@ A player is dependent on their own body .
it is therefore also investing in many other a@@ ven@@ les of money into poor maintenance and re@@ production in order to stay in the top form .
the Y@@ re@@ my F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler portal for ES@@ P@@ .@@ com to look at how far there are some al@@ er@@ ans are ready to go to go to their own po@@ ta@@ to . let us pro@@ cras@@ tin@@ ate .
however , no case is as extreme as extreme as the 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , 14 years , in the G20 . the player on the protection line .
according to F@@ wa@@ w@@ ler , Har@@ ris@@ is 300 000 dollars per year on the br@@ ink of USD 300 000 per year . to put in practical practices and to the ban@@ kers .
most of the costs relate to the travel of the country to meet with specialists .
&apos;@@ I do not need to have a record of such things &apos; , Har@@ ris@@ ing has said .
&apos;@@ when compared with my expenditure , the payments are worthy of this , given how I feel &apos; .

the 3@@ 0-@@ year-old Mitchell of the year has been rela@@ xing the body ( in English &apos; ) , as Mr F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler described as &apos; 55 years &apos; ) , which Mr F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler described as &apos; 55 the use of the kil@@ o me@@ tals &apos; .
&apos;@@ L@@ et himself on it , Mr Mitchell said .
&apos;@@ when you have a seat in the top place , and they are going to move around , it is sometimes painful .
however , when you stand up , the tension has now disappeared .
this is just under way out of the tension &apos; .
they are ready to make additional efforts , but the former N@@ V@@ As , Mr Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d and R@@ y@@ an Har@@ ris will spend a year on recovery . on average , 50 000 dollars .
Co@@ field , who played 10 season in the ran@@ ks of New York , Gi@@ an@@ ts and Washington Reding , have expressed their regret that he did not . spent more .
&apos;@@ if I could go back , I would like to invest even more &apos; , Mr F@@ ow@@ le@@ r , said &apos; .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ ter would probably take more than two times .
I was the first eight years of a very good health .
the end would perhaps have been helpful in more procedures &apos; .
R@@ yan S@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old forest protection line , expressed its willingness to enter into its te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y S@@ ti@@ le@@ r@@ si &apos;s team . in the foot@@ steps of my fellow children .
&apos;@@ if you have a sum of 100 000 dollars , and there is a rather simple &apos; , Mr Sha@@ z@@ i@@ i@@ er said .
as far as the career is concerned , investment in the recovery of players is much smar@@ ter than money spent on cars and vegetables .
at the centre of the N@@ FL@@ -@@ A player , if it can be able to play longer than 30 years , all the more so Har@@ ris@@ ard &apos;s success . on the second point .
however , perhaps they will be able to find a few local specialists .
how the prin@@ ter Di@@ ana was using her me@@ al weapon
when I think of the following , Mrs Di@@ versity , the first thing we need to do is a bridge with our eyes .
a young gir@@ l in a young gir@@ l .
the black wave of the black wave of his Martin B@@ ash@@ ir , the &apos; Pan@@ or@@ am@@ a &apos; inter@@ view , the effects of which was devastating when he was carrying through through . the c@@ oo@@ ki@@ es have looked at , taking the famous inf@@ ant fa@@ ble phrase : &apos; we were three in this mar@@ ch , so it was slightly too popular &apos; that is the case .
the big and no@@ tori@@ ous eyes , surroun@@ ded by his s@@ qu@@ est , a f@@ las@@ h in the black line , left the impression of being left open to the impression of it .
it is this effect that he has attempted to achieve .
outside the public , the prin@@ ter Di@@ ana was never involved in a particularly me@@ al , at least not on the basis of the modern standards .
it was not just that he did not need it - he was , of course , beautiful - but he saw this type of commitment , something that is more related to it . work as a sha@@ m .
he may have had a car@@ te in the public .
once again he came in the office of Con@@ de , V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , the office of the publis@@ hers &apos; office , carrying the co@@ tax , almost or@@ an@@ ge of or@@ an@@ ge . the la@@ yer .
he was sorry to say that his s@@ in will be as if it goes out &apos; normally &apos; normally &apos; , as if he were to go out &apos; normally &apos; , then wal@@ king out . photo@@ graph@@ no@@ graph@@ s pic@@ ked him and then put all the accusations that he sees &apos; minor &apos; , &apos; more heated &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; . that is the case .
it is for this reason that Mrs Di@@ ana three times a week in an insult to its own home .
today , of course , it would be a bad thing for healthy reasons , but for Di@@ ana , it enabled him to show the world the nature of its head , even though . the black cl@@ out and bo@@ xes were handled by black cl@@ ou@@ ds .
one of the greatest error in the K@@ ing family was expected to think that if they approve it as a hus@@ band &apos;s hus@@ band , they will be able to live with one small co@@ ins . a person who only has the sugar wh@@ is@@ t@@ t .
the opposite was true , however .
he may not be the best of class in school , but when it was about the creation of an im@@ passion@@ ate school .
in Mrs Di@@ ana , the importance of the man was that it was possible to use them to be used .
otherwise , they did not have the slightest interest .
his friend R@@ os@@ k Mon@@ ck@@ ton - Di@@ ana Di@@ ana was in her youn@@ gest child in memory of her - remember that there was nothing of what they were doing to talk about .
&apos;@@ L@@ et &apos; I remember this &apos; , he said , &apos; how much relief he felt in those times when we went together , and he did not have myself . the &apos; .
today , we tend to think about a man as something that improves the woman &apos;s expression , but when looking back at the loss of a woman , it is clear that we are looking back to the life cover , it is clear that he used it as a tool of P@@ P@@ R .
these moments in which he felt the most free of all was his own , these moments , when he was also the most natural in which he was also the most natural , by carrying out the most natural . a very little amount of us .
in 1993 , together with our two young son T@@ hor@@ pe in H@@ hor@@ ll , Le@@ a@@ ve , he was going through . wake up and pra@@ ised the day , in ri@@ ps@@ the@@ ma@@ k@@ el@@ s , as in any other mother , who will spend the day with children .
four months after the announcement was announced by his and C@@ har@@ ler , he finally saw an ou@@ t@@ ingly worrying and &apos; normal &apos; .
or in a later years , you will see a tra@@ ce of bic@@ y@@ cle , Je@@ ws , you are in the middle of the bic@@ y@@ cles , I see a tra@@ ce in cy@@ c@@ lists . this is pu@@ mp@@ ing , health and vita@@ lity of life from every one of his son .
the end of his life , when he started his or her independence , we saw more and more of this kind of Di@@ ana .
he has committed himself to the H@@ al@@ o T@@ Neighbourhood and wal@@ king in January 1997 .
at that time , the Je@@ ws at the moment , Jewish soft and natural , almost almost entirely me@@ ig@@ i@@ free , he would probably see a ne@@ m out of more than ever . in the past , reminding you of this remains a sh@@ ining and hopeful young gir@@ l who , 15 years ago , were s@@ mil@@ ing .
Mrs Di@@ ana was just reaching its best years .
in the early times , a young at S@@ pen@@ c@@ er , a young at the time of the early nature of R@@ a@@ ff@@ ers .
however , it was not long until the &apos; prin@@ ted dis@@ gu@@ ised &apos; - a process that was carried out mainly by the press and the pal@@ e , in order to do so . a young woman who would be worth in his new state of affairs .
it was in part in part of the C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ ward , ve@@ ter@@ n@@ an@@ e , who L@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ on has often used photo@@ graph@@ s . the se@@ at@@ ings , the work of the day .
Mr Ho@@ w@@ ard met for the first time in S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on , in S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on , in S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on , in order to perpe@@ tu@@ ate the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine V@@ o@@ gu@@ s . an official la@@ yer .
at this moment , at the end of the 1980s , Mrs Di@@ ana was at the end of the 1980s .
his most fine beau@@ ty licences were origin@@ ated from Mr Bo@@ dy S@@ h@@ op@@ t , for example , the O@@ der@@ f@@ lor@@ a .
Mr F@@ ac@@ tor@@ i S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us &apos;s H@@ one@@ y Tou@@ bon , S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us on that occasion , H@@ one@@ y Tou@@ bon and Ma@@ x F@@ A . in the meantime , the F@@ ro@@ me C@@ or@@ al , F@@ ro@@ s@@ d C@@ or@@ al .
he was we@@ a@@ ten by E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den R@@ ic@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den R@@ ice and Tim@@ ber@@ l@@ and and a white , white bul@@ l . at the time of the day , there is the ref@@ e@@ of .
the external action of E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den S@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den S@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den , is improving the EU . that is the case .
and we know all of this , because Ho@@ w@@ ard created a man for her .
&apos;@@ Di@@ versity is both an admi@@ rable col@@ ours that I wanted to stress the fact that he said &apos; , he was written later .
the end result is not particularly attractive for such a young gir@@ l - he looks like a 18 years old , which is becoming 50 .
it is too op@@ pres@@ sive and has been given too much fore@@ ver li@@ g@@ ni@@ te .
the most striking here , however , is the no@@ tori@@ ous bridge with a bridge from the villa@@ ge in this tonnes of tonnes of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s bri@@ ef@@ in . that was the case .
the F@@ an@@ ta@@ si@@ cs as a fan@@ tas@@ y .
it is not wonder why Mrs Di@@ ana was somewhat un@@ sure of us .
one source of the source of Di@@ versity was the fact that he was never aware of where the public family is coming to an end .
it was the beginning of this process .
a person who is likely to be most affected by Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l , who plays an important role in the modern world of today . the role .
the Me@@ ig@@ u@@ st@@ ist , who is now among others , for C@@ han@@ a@@ i , is still one of the countries of the world .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an incredibly beautiful lea@@ ther and long ca@@ gi@@ ous &apos; , it is re@@ minis@@ cent .
&apos;@@ he was simply a wonderful mira@@ cle .
the men spoke him .
he was a se@@ in , without her having been trying to do so &apos; .
the M@@ ary met , for the first time in 199@@ 1 , when V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , asked him asked him to do . there was a photo@@ graph@@ ic photo@@ graph@@ y Pat@@ x@@ er , the photo@@ graph@@ y Pat@@ x@@ er D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ er D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ er D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ er D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ e@@ er .
the team bel@@ on@@ ged , S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ger .
it was then when Mrs and C@@ har@@ ley were the greatest and public support .
&apos;@@ they did not tell us who is , although we knew that this is a very famous famous &apos; , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ Ne@@ el@@ l .
&apos;@@ when we came up , Mrs Di@@ ana was simply standing there , a so@@ ya and friendly and extremely ex@@ ci@@ tement , that it can be the V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos; the presentation &apos; .
it is a ro@@ cky picture - Di@@ ana le@@ th@@ led by the pu@@ ppe@@ s , the hor@@ ro@@ g reli@@ ed on the hands , his blue eyes , your eyes , cy@@ nic@@ ism . for e@@ leg@@ ant French man@@ ic , Je@@ ws for short cut - was up@@ he@@ aval@@ led .
this radi@@ ation , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and e@@ leg@@ ant .
above all , it was a modern , giving it to the n@@ ine@@ ties of early n@@ ine@@ es , and by creating a strong contrast to Di@@ ana and the strong contrast . the K@@ ing family , who had a &apos; do@@ se Cro@@ ats &apos; , as the Qu@@ e@@ en was subsequently mentioned by the K@@ ing .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana was very ten@@ se with his man .
he simply wanted to see a fresh and different &apos; , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
during time he was taught himself to be taught himself - the rule , the che@@ ck@@ ling rule , the pe@@ er , the pe@@ er , the pe@@ er , the be@@ et of c@@ ool our eyes . the ash cl@@ oud - and he emphasised healthy sk@@ in care , encouraging her to look after itself and to follow the word &apos; internal beau@@ ty &apos; .
Di@@ ana &apos; did everything in a moderate way , G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
he was s@@ lee@@ ping enough and reduced alcohol consumption , which is very important for the benefit of the poor .
I prefer Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in &apos;s speech , Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in , C@@ lar@@ s , C@@ lar@@ s , C@@ lar@@ s , C@@ lar@@ s . the &apos; catch-the-eye &apos; dimension .
however , the greatest service was made by M@@ ary Di@@ ana , was his ali@@ en@@ ated to you from the blue side .
&apos;@@ that was just as much parents &apos; , he said .
instead , it used the combination of bro@@ wn bro@@ thers and neutral ton@@ es , together with the bro@@ wn a@@ ci@@ a@@ ci@@ s , with the bro@@ wn of lea@@ gue , which were between each other . it has been said , so everything was fine .
it often often used the tone of the tone and a little sun@@ c@@ ers , that Mrs Di@@ ana needs to be emphasised .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an was a ha@@ bit of telling me , and I would like to call on me to discuss the products that I very much like to say &apos; , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ a@@ u said &apos; . el@@ l me .
&apos;@@ I think it was a rela@@ x for him ; the possibility of taking a few moments &apos; .
his le@@ as@@ k was a luxury mark in C@@ lar@@ in@@ i .
Mrs Di@@ ana has allegedly used to clean light milk for their sensitive s@@ kin@@ s , and for the clean@@ ing milk of these Al@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ hu@@ r milk and the tone of their Al@@ p@@ p@@ hu@@ r milk .
he also played a cosme@@ tic about a regularly ex@@ hibi@@ tion in the F@@ il@@ der@@ man in Central London .
Mr President , Mr President , was a beautiful s@@ m@@ oo@@ ther , but sometimes she had a ro@@ ckets , a moderate a@@ rou@@ ses , which is often the result of stress .
in order to mitigate this , it used the natural dis@@ orders , including the oil of fib@@ re oil .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an has a mag@@ nific@@ ent luxury structure &apos; , was said by G@@ re@@ en@@ wal@@ l .
the only part of his appearance in relation to which he was very confident was he .
Mr Harkin re@@ marked : &apos; once the newspapers wrote that he had visited the N@@ in@@ but in his rhetoric , he addressed me to me and said . in the different : &apos; honestly , if I had been allowed to bur@@ n its whe@@ at , whether you are going to have chosen ? &apos;
when M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ Ne@@ el@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ u@@ h@@ t &apos;s advice started to have closed , Mrs Di@@ ana herself with her new expression . more and more confident about this .
one of its most dis@@ gus@@ ting cases - in 1994 in 1994 , the Ser@@ pen@@ tine Fron@@ t in London in 1994 , where he had a famous &apos; re@@ bel@@ lion &apos; . it was &apos; , a provo@@ cative , un@@ profitable , f@@ ig@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ ry , Mrs Sta@@ v@@ oli@@ de , is showing that it started to take shape during the end of his life .
for short and over the deser@@ ts , Mrs Di@@ ana at the same time is Di@@ ary and dynamic , his short F@@ en@@ g in sharp contrast to the acute con@@ tras@@ ts . it is a call for a black black b@@ id@@ le .
he is a perfect - attractive but , at the same time , a hu@@ mble , a black bridge in the face of his eyes .
without simply , e@@ lep@@ h@@ ments , particularly red tape , c@@ iting co@@ red la@@ yer , it is rather likely to be the fo@@ d@@ der , quite possibly Re@@ v@@ l@@ k , quite possibly Re@@ v@@ l@@ k . there are a line which then became a trade@@ mark in some respects .
a few months later , he avoided his e@@ leg@@ ant of a red man@@ ager in the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom .
the prin@@ ce was the level of health and self-@@ confidence .
finally , he has full control .
the daily and in its form , his me@@ k , he will do exactly what he wants to think : here there is a woman who seems to have to think : here there is a woman who seems to have to say : there is a woman who seems to have to do so . it is , after all , a self-@@ background and the purpose of life and , after all , having received just 36 , found their place .
it is a real pity that he did not prove that .

it is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice will examine the T@@ on Po@@ ti .
in order for someone to be able to account for this , according to Bur@@ ns , the &apos; clear elements &apos; must be clearly proven &apos; .
he said that &apos; on this subject , with reference to the investigation and decision of the former Secretary of State ( H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton M@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton M@@ ill@@ ary H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton , and the decision of the decision . not to present .
these considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its exact classi@@ fications .
in the case of secrecy , the prosecu@@ tors are investigating whether the document has been le@@ ak@@ ed to an un@@ authorised person in a way that has a negative impact on the interests of the United States .
&apos;@@ if all this can be proven , people can no doubt have a criminal protection in the situation &apos; , in Bur@@ ns .
&apos;@@ there is no doubt &apos; .
when it comes to the trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone calls , the G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was a public prosecu@@ tor for the spi@@ on@@ ing cases , the Pro@@ secu@@ tor of the S@@ on@@ i@@ i@@ a@@ i , who was a public prosecu@@ tor for S@@ J@@ i@@ i@@ i@@ ans . such documents are &apos; usually clas@@ sed as being smugg@@ led and higher in &apos; .
by arguing that these le@@ aks threaten the ability of the US Government to pursue foreign policy , a address to the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor General , a f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist criminal prosecu@@ tor . the whole of the men to find the le@@ vers .
he also said that the Washington Po@@ t re@@ por@@ ters and ed@@ it@@ ors telephone calls from the Washington Po@@ st re@@ por@@ ters and ed@@ it@@ ors telephone calls should be provided - that is something . what the re@@ por@@ ters will no doubt be prote@@ sting against .
in the case of U@@ TA@@ H , Mr Le@@ e , said on Thursday , Cap@@ it@@ ol H@@ il@@ l , on Thursday , that there should be criminal offences . the procedure .
&apos;@@ We need to find a person who le@@ ak@@ ed them - he must be punished , and he must be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed by Le@@ e Ne@@ ws &apos; . in Ne@@ w@@ si H@@ Q &apos; .
&apos;@@ this is unacceptable and should never happen &apos; .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before he was elected in the Senate in 2010 , it said that such ca@@ ke is a &apos; crime , a very serious federal crime &apos; that is the case .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at does not , and should not be accompanied only by dis@@ mis@@ sal but also criminal proceedings , given that the classified information is involved in the &apos; war .
F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws were said that at this stage the announcement by the Ministry of Justice to give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , not to explain certain things . the procedures .
the last week was criticised by President S@@ es@@ sion@@ an , and has kept her an@@ ger publicly on the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor , stating that it is not enough enough to find the le@@ vers . that is the case .
&apos;@@ I would like the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor would be much more afraid of the le@@ aks that come from the security agencies &apos; , the tru@@ m said on 25 July . that is the case .
in S@@ es@@ view , last week , F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws Tu@@ c@@ ker Car@@ l@@ son , that he is not satisfied with what the President is to the President . since his in@@ audi@@ ence , we have repeatedly set up obstacles to the efforts made .
&apos;@@ I have not been satisfied with the procedures and en@@ quiries of the past , said in the wall .
even some of the President critically take the floor , saying that this practice is detrimental to foreign policy efforts .
a trans@@ cri@@ ption of the President of the President and the leader of the foreign country , is scandalous , shocking and dangerous &apos; , David f@@ ru@@ m on Thursday . high .
&apos;@@ It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate in a confidenti@@ al way - and perhaps even more importantly , that the leaders of the foreign countries understand that they will be able to answer the confidenti@@ al answer &apos; .
Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner ( D@@ -@@ V@@ a ) , the leader of the Security Committee , Mr Da@@ il@@ y B@@ ear@@ as@@ ti , was also said by Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner . that the &apos; absolutely &apos; worrying &apos; is &apos; absolutely &apos; worrying and the Congress should investigate this .

he said W@@ C@@ V@@ TV that he is not going to give up , without win@@ ning , and has submitted an appeal .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w to this in all honesty , when he said in this .
and I think that people should fight in any form , especially on the one hand .
Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that the country of the Union of hom@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness is not in line with the values of the S@@ oul@@ view .

he said that there has been four years in the area .

the messages from the S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ ki Union did not receive an immediate response from Thursday morning .
some of the A@@ ck@@ er@@ t neighbour , W@@ C@@ TV said that the letter was slightly harsh , and they were not particularly surprised by the actions of the citizens &apos; Union .
&apos;@@ &apos; they do such things all the time &apos; , M@@ ate Ste@@ ph@@ en@@ son .
in my view , this is ridiculous .
why should there not be patri@@ otic in our own country ?
Mr P@@ A@@ T@@ EL said : &apos; it is a ve@@ ter@@ n@@ ity who served our country .
it is just a flag , a flag .
I do not think this is right .
the house belongs to him , at least it could be allowed .
it has been said in the citizens &apos; Union that the A@@ ck@@ er@@ t has 15 days to remove around 15 days , otherwise he will be going to be fined .

the two influential women share their success in the secrecy
what is the joint Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an@@ o and La@@ il@@ a A@@ ve ?
at first gl@@ ance , these women come from two completely different parts of the world .
the New York ob@@ session with Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , has been able to turn a mil@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar loan for five billion years before implementing the ro@@ cket . its expertise on the scre@@ ens , by participating in the K@@ IC@@ C &apos;s seriousness of the gra@@ vity of the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s seriousness of life and of investors .
La@@ il@@ a Ali has come to his father in the foot@@ steps , sending four times as the most successful female bo@@ x@@ er to the most successful female bo@@ x@@ er , before her . the role of the res@@ former , the author and the speaker , the authors and the speaker .
in spite of their unique career routes ( or perhaps because they are due to the fact that the T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x has on both women , so that they would help to speak in the Chamber . for the sake of hope to the rich , the fra@@ gi@@ lity of stereotypes and achieving ambitious objectives .
last year , T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x hundreds of women in shops across the country and found that 80 % of them feel that society has given them stereotypes . the dark and expectations of the roles .
consequently , they came up with Mr Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou , in order to help women to break these barriers .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ on and Mr Ali know a great deal about it , and they may be at the top of this area , but it was not a smooth way for both of them .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an has already been in the middle school and the College , and had been working for the age of the age of 10 years .
there was one of the most male areas of one of the most male areas , and , in addition , we were trying to try to get out their own father early , who was the bri@@ ef@@ s . it is .
the two were , by saying , two of the knowledge acquired by the difficulties .
that is why we set out these influential women in order to talk about overcoming the failures , the success of the success and the lack of our concern about trust in business and in relationships .
what will insp@@ ire you to do what we deal with every day ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am insp@@ iring my personal aims on a daily basis .
I have sha@@ ped the ha@@ bit of what I would like to achieve .
and I look at the list .
I find myself responsible .
I will , of course , insp@@ ire my children .
my ambition will insp@@ ire me .
I would like to be a victory for everything that I do in life .
I realise that the achievement of my objectives requires a serious work , but I am prepared to do so .
my confidence is the result of preparation .
I will therefore spend a lot of time to prepare .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : as in La@@ ke , I am a key to confidence in the preparation , but I will not draw its inspiration from it .
in actual fact , I am an inspiration for the news of the news .
what will happen if I do so ?
what will not be if I do not do that ?
this news b@@ ing@@ on me this morning , because I cannot expect what the day brings with it .
if , in some day , I do not pre@@ tend to make these senti@@ ments .
then I will stay in my own m@@ ood and I have taken inspiration again .
talk about a few obstacle to their career , which has made you better in the long term .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : it was the most difficult for me to have been left behind my business partner and my secre@@ tari@@ al .
I have completed a year later , but it was a year of my life - was horri@@ ble because I did not have enough confidence to leave .
I felt humili@@ ated , there was no inspiration .
but the amaz@@ ing things are happening .
it is most difficult to believe in this moment when you are hit by set@@ backs .
it was a very difficult year for our own feet and the re-@@ start of business - this time without a partner - has been extremely difficult .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I would say that my career was the most difficult time when I was dealing with bo@@ arding , I was at the top of my career . I decided to give the divorce into the divorce .
I did not separate my hus@@ band alone , but also of the then someone who taught me all of what I know about the bo@@ arding . that is the case .
I did not believe that I can do without it .
so I started to worry about the future of my career and I had to find time to take a step back and say : &apos; you have all the necessary knowledge and experience .
you have all these experiences in the bo@@ y community .
you will certainly be able to do so &apos; .
therefore , I was re-@@ established a new team , and I continued my career .
in fact , it was simply necessary to achieve the right stage , as the rest of the rest was there .
I did what needs to be done , I had to face with fear and find the courage to get rid of their hus@@ b@@ ands and the mountain and to continue with their careers and to continue with their careers . everyone was left .
when did you know that you have really made progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I felt that I have made a success if I won the title of my first man &apos;s champi@@ on@@ ship .
it was a really good feeling , because , starting with the bo@@ y , I wanted to be one of the best , to be un@@ win@@ ning .
I was able to achieve this , and I did not win the title of the champi@@ on@@ ship , but in four cases .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : a moment when I felt that I have made a success , was my 11 years of operation .
I was in the end at last .
I had made a profit of around 42 000 of the profits that I could not expected .
I went out straight away and I bought a new car , both a mother and a father of a new car , they never had a new car . where they have considered their retirement age .
I felt myself as the Qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I found myself as a f@@ right .
I am going to do much more in the coming years , but nothing has been able to offer the same sense of being able to give their parents something back and to ra@@ va@@ ged by surprise .
how have you been motivated in this 11 years in order to continue working ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I have never quanti@@ fied their business activities according to the profits , as it was not my intention .
I just wanted to see how far I can reach .
I have already set the dream of having a dream of a new es@@ tate in New York .
and I saw myself as a P@@ ope - all of you are caught by my friend and God .
my family was such a little thought .
so , when I have made an effort every day , every hour , I actually did not think about the service .
finally , I did not get the money .
however , all the money that came up , I immediately turned back to the wa@@ y@@ side .
I do not even believe that I was at all a dis@@ da@@ tory days , where I would have thought that , for good@@ ness , we will not earn money .
I was simply convinced that something is going to work .
the worst thing that could happen , would have been to lose a company and a pretext for the pretext .
I then do a good drin@@ k money and I was happy .
I could be happy .
therefore , I do not believe that a great deal of progress has been made by the people .
they are the other mo@@ tives that are driven by them .
and the money was not one of my own .
do you have any advice to anyone who has such great dre@@ ams , but who will keep the financial factor back ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : when I started a lot of money , I had the money to invest in property , but I had no time .
Mr R@@ aj@@ al@@ ta &apos;s business .
and that is why I have found five different partners , who were not even specialists in the bro@@ k@@ er@@ r@@ sk , but in the various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , in the various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , who felt in the different neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds . today , let us go through .
I am going to them to them and I said : &apos; you have known this neighbourhood .
my best building is the best building .
I am going to give you money and you will be my partner .
the lesson here is that if you have money , you will be the people to earn money from money .
and , if you have an tal@@ ent , you may sell it to someone who has money , and instead to make money .
there are two aspects here : An@@ ne and money .
but if there is not both together , nothing will happen very much .
in the end , I - and also my partners - for all these years , with their major investors , whom I would never have been . I would not have had the courage to find a com@@ ba@@ tive people who like to go up .
it is always possible to obtain money if the religions is that you have an tal@@ ent and feelings of our part of the world than anyone else .
we are talking about this morning : what are these two or three things that you are doing every morning , which will help you make progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I do not know about you , but I have a lot of moments in life , when I feel over@@ burden@@ ed , when I feel over@@ burden@@ ed , when I have a mother , let me not lose sight . well , the spo@@ use ... all these roles that we play in women &apos;s ...
I have reached a point in my life , where I really had to put this morning in order .
I like to stand up and just feel gratitude .
gratitude to the up@@ ris@@ ings , our health , their children , for their own family .
I am often going to write what my objectives will be for the next day , when I wake up , I am going to look again at the list .
Mrs Me@@ di@@ vi@@ in .
I sometimes write to the day &apos;s ro@@ tation .
the line always comes in the po@@ cket .
and I will always do the first thing this morning , because if I do not do so , it will not do so .
for me , this is ultimately about priorities .
these are things that are important to me : the focus of my session , the focus on the uni@@ verse and God , then training and putting their health first first . that is the case .
it seems to be quite simple , thanks to that .
I feel that I am able to stand by all the challenges that come from my way .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I am going to take matters of importance .
I will work through the list of its duties , which is endless and lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us .
and I put in place what is most important .
what are the real priorities ?
I will try to agree on achieving the most important things .
what are you doing to bring ourselves a big meeting in the right room ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I am going to fail .
it is as strange as it is not .
I am thinking that I@@ ss@@ land , I am failing .
I would like to say myself , and that makes me more effort .
I can imagine anyone who compete with me - I am a very com@@ ba@@ tive in nature , as I am one of ten children , and we were never able to pay enough attention to their parents . that is the case .
I can be very competi@@ tor .
and I always come to be too thoroughly prepared .
the excessive preparation will strengthen my confidence .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : ast@@ ounding , how opposing we are in this regard .
we are two successful people , and this shows how unlike things are working for different people .
I like to imagine that I am successful .
I like to think about the end of the success .
I can imagine this in fact , I see it in fact .
I see the entry of the bo@@ xes , the struggle to take place , as a winner of the winner and a return space for ri@@ ce , marks a victory for a victory in the code . as I have always done .
the same applies to the meetings .
however , I am always preparing to do so ; this confidence is a result of preparation , because the fear that I do not go well , or I am not going to say the right things . or do not get the information they need .
here is the preparation of the game for me .
however , I will always enter the final result in pa@@ ving the end result .
you have both been very successful in our career .
how are you going to pass it ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am very exc@@ iting to be part of T@@ .@@ J@@ . M@@ IN@@ X@@ X@@ I from the Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou project , as I feel that this is an opportunity to do a good thing .
very many women need to be encouraged , encouraging them to pursue their dre@@ ams and objectives .
in all , there is the Chech@@ ens .
it is , in fact , in a demonstration and in having the necessary tools , in their surroun@@ dings , with the people who have been able to achieve things that you are trying to achieve . that is the case .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one of the things that I do , in my view , is the insp@@ iring of people .
I was therefore very pleased when I was asked to work with Mr Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject .
I will try to make the f@@ ence of indi@@ visibility and inspiration that we see here in the face of all these people , and to give them practical advice on how to move forward .
many people are beginning to start with their dre@@ ams , but tend to be mis@@ led at some point in point .
so we will try to help them focus on this objective .
everything that we teach is practical .
it is not just as simple as a f@@ ti@@ r speech , everything we need to set up a company .
what advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in the male field ?
Mrs Ali : I am acting in one of the most male areas , which is the han@@ ging .
to come after my father , who was the best of all times , was rather discoura@@ ging .
for me , the core of the matter was actually about its tal@@ ent , courage , in the self-@@ perpe@@ tu@@ ation .
the first thing I did was to believe in the former that I am able to go and to be successful .
at that time , no one was left to the same , and I did not have any restrictions on what I was set up for myself .
if you believe in and to find our passion , no one can stop you .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the road to take inspiration and , in my view , the building of New York on the building of New York on the building of New York - and the fin@@ ishing tou@@ ches . there is a huge amount of time .
there is a need for many tal@@ ent in this interim phase , a lot of tal@@ ents are needed .
there is no need to act with the ob@@ session with ob@@ session .
I am sure that in the area of La@@ il@@ a , it was also necessary to decide what the right people , when to start when we will not have a lot out . the money is what can be put in place , which cannot be prepared to do how hard they are ready to work .
these are all the subjec@@ tive decisions .
I will try to make these efforts a bit more , so that these women really feel : &apos; o@@ ils , I now understood .
let me try .
here I have three priorities &apos; .
if they are leaving the three main priorities that things really do to happen , I am going to go back at home , if they are leaving the three main priority .
what is your din@@ ner today ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : too much troika .
ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , books , small wages , my daily cor@@ n .
water trees are likely to be on water .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I have a little green light to my din@@ ner , because I tried to break the ha@@ bit of life every morning . the phone will be revised .
I therefore received it .
it was a mer@@ ger .
but it has never worked .
and is still standing there .
and my clo@@ ck is still my night .
what is you going to book now ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : E@@ igh@@ th or n@@ in@@ th time in order to gain friends and influence the people &apos; .
this will keep me on the right track .
I believe that this is still the best book , which is written in this area is not a distinction that is made of the dre@@ ams , which are not possible to achieve without other people . that is the case .
and it will be possible to take this up in exactly the same way as in the past .
I like to read it from time to time .
this will enable me to go on the right road .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : let me learn a school in school , which is why I read the paper &apos; N@@ e@@ v@@ et &apos; .
it is about the eating of cereals and how they will affect our body .
I am very interested in this .
what is your best advice to deal with success and failures ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : ignore the was@@ h .
they are met by all kinds of different forms .
you need to get them out of the b@@ reat@@ h .
keep away from the v@@ ans .
they wonder about energy .
I take the lead as to the property .
they will come from night and they are going to go and they are leaving .
the pessimis@@ ts destroy any team team more quickly than you can look at the eyes of you , because the people who are mer@@ ging themselves , want the people who are mer@@ ging themselves , want to see . others , too , would feel badly .
they are attra@@ cting good people together with them .
I can avoid perfectly all the negative people in the radi@@ ation of 50 km in the radi@@ ation of 50 km , as my aim is to be positive and take all of what is done . I have to offer .
so why should I want to be able to spend a minute on these people ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : it must be consistent .
we will start with a great deal of conviction that we are now taking this route .
we are doing this , and that is what we are doing .
however , people do not follow this long enough .
sometimes they give them just before they reach the last fuel .
I therefore believe that it is necessary to stay on track .
how senti@@ ment to something about something , the religions , then you must be consistent .
and you are also doing a hard job in the success of success .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : a lot of effort must be made to ensure consistency .
do you know what needs to be done ?
the conclusion of things .
if you start something , then it will stop it .
many are the drivers , but not in particular , the gradu@@ ates .
the Chinese Internet cen@@ sors play a complex co@@ at and mo@@ use of the game
according to the experts , a threa@@ d that can affect many users from the time of science to businesses that China is feeling increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou seem to be more and more intensive , but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever before &apos; , Mr Par@@ ker , who has written the book &apos; . well , I quote the K@@ ra@@ de Com@@ ra@@ de Com@@ ra@@ des K@@ ra@@ de Com@@ ra@@ de A@@ ra@@ b A@@ re , on the Internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
the restrictions imposed on the Internet in Beijing are proportionate to the Internet &apos;s influence in China .
according to experts , China has not yet strengthened the control of China and , in many cases , the game will continue to grow and mo@@ use .
one day after the A@@ pp@@ le was launched last week , people began to spread the way in the Chinese social media how to access these tools , which are so simple . in order for this to be even a technical ali@@ en .
this included the registration of a person &apos;s applications to another country where the V@@ P@@ N applications are still available .
nevertheless , the day of Thursday shows that China wants to change the game for the benefit of the game .
a number of Chinese Internet providers had said on Thursday their social media accounts on Thursday , on the websites or by us that the Chinese security officials are tested a new way in which these services are tested . the Internet addresses , which is dis@@ su@@ a@@ ting or using illegal content .
if they have been found , the authorities are asking for the operators to request that Internet service providers would be required to put an end to their customers .
if the cli@@ ents continue , service providers and the Chinese officials to these Community minutes .
the Ministry of Security did not repli@@ ed to a comment .
studies indicate that in China , tens of millions of millions of people in the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ e and other types of sof@@ tw@@ are to escape from the Great day .
although many people are excluded from foreign television programmes and por@@ no@@ graph@@ ic , many people are making them a huge amount of online internet users &apos; community . challenges .
the Chinese President , X@@ I , the Chinese President , has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet for the years , but it has also increased technology and the Internet as a criticism of the Internet . the factors in China &apos;s future economic development .
as the cyber@@ space has begun to play a central role in the whole of China .
it is difficult to find out the scope of the new aspirations , as many users and companies will not discuss them in public , in fear of being paraly@@ sed by the Chinese Government .
however , some frequent users have said that it is becoming more and more difficult .
one student who learning in the United States and the lea@@ gue in China in China , said that he was blocked by the local V@@ P@@ N .
according to my own friends , he took this period as a sort of nature of the social media and he left Mr F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k from his friends to explain why he has his friends . it is as though the land needed .
a school student at one University in China said that it has become more difficult to carry out research , although the university has become more difficult , even though the university has found alternatives to the university . the prin@@ ted publication of pupils would not always need the Internet .
it is now saying that he has now found a new way to by@@ pass , without dis@@ closing what it is about .
according to the Chinese Internet observers , some sections of the V@@ P@@ N are still working , and China would have much more to be done to intensify the restrictions .
&apos;@@ We believe that if the government had decided to do so , it would have been much more in the use of the V@@ P@@ N . the website created in 2015 , which will help China &apos;s users to find a representative .
&apos;@@ if the government had done more , it would be a much more complex &apos; , a representative who has refused to nomin@@ ate itself in China due to the sensitivity of the group &apos;s work in China .
&apos;@@ apparently they did not do so , because they must leave the people or businesses a little brea@@ thing space &apos; .
the Chinese online restrictions are often cyclical .
the current climate is partly due to the imminent meeting of the Chinese Communist Party , which is the 19@@ th party that is taking place in the autumn .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ P was caught un@@ foreseen at the time .
as economic policy or external affairs , there are also censorship in China as part of a complex and often defici@@ ent political process .
according to analy@@ sts , the government minis@@ tries in the government of the government in the face of the Congress , that they are effective and can intervene in the event of a problem .
&apos;@@ so this is certainly not the case of the K@@ P@@ N a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ sis &apos; , the consultation company E@@ u@@ ra@@ ice G@@ ro@@ u@@ a global technological player . the leader of the leader , Paul Tri@@ o .
&apos;@@ S@@ users a more complex environment and new opportunities and approaches allow China to simply better certain parts of the use of the V@@ P@@ N &apos;s use at the time chosen by the V@@ P@@ N . to include &apos; , he said .
the Chinese population is learning in the past early age to deal with these difficulties .
in the past this summer , the Chinese gi@@ ant T@@ en@@ c@@ but started the time in which the younger and 18 were allowed to play a popular online online game . in the K@@ ing@@ s , allowing it to be done an hour a day for those who are younger than 12 , and two hours for those who are between the ages of 12 .
for this reason , the young people in China have begun to make use of counterfeit documents .
&apos;@@ is your &apos; Com@@ h@@ on@@ or of the K@@ ing@@ s &apos; will be curta@@ iled ?
are you interested in obtaining a document , which shows that you are older than 18 , &apos; asked the recent advertising in China &apos;s social media .
&apos;@@ No &apos; is not a problem .
you are in contact that the cheap@@ est document would be to obtain a document .

in recent years , the large technology companies have put in place the &apos; poor poor money &apos; to form@@ alise the process of reporting and compensa@@ ting for their work .
it has also been a ten@@ se relationship with security experts from all over the world , there has also been a ten@@ se relationship with the law enforcement agencies .

and in less than two weeks before the death , he was attended by the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y City , when he was killed , he was talking about D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
his death was announced by D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ o@@ y , without mentioning the cause .
he was 8@@ 3 years old .

Le@@ e@@ gi@@ on@@ business is another infection that has spread to this medicine , but he did not have a c@@ ry of this medicine , but he did not have a c@@ ry or a lack of investment .
even more , the bac@@ teri@@ um Sta@@ ph@@ on@@ s , the bac@@ teri@@ us au@@ x@@ us may cause excessive ca@@ talo@@ gue , but , again , he does not . there have been over-@@ frequency complaints .
in spite of this , we are going to start to start a broad level of antibio@@ tic treatment that would cover all these dangers .
however , in the case of the patient , he was not in the hands of a serious infection .
doctors were not antibio@@ tic to him .
doctors had the chance to delay the use of antibiotics , and just to follow and wait , but if the patient had one of them , but when the patient had one of them , in the case of which he had read . it may even have been def@@ er@@ red by a couple of hours to end the death .
the situation was even more complicated by the fact that he thought he was aller@@ gic to a pen@@ al card , even though he did not remember what happened . he was taking it .
this created the risk and benefits of the ratio .
as traditionally as low contributions , whether to start the use of antibiotics or not , it will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked my fellow Member in the second resident , the patient .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard did not tell my colleague that he is going to have to look at the patient and give our recommendation .
my colleague met the patient and agreed .
even though he saw a good thing , he would have been virtually defence@@ less in the case of the L@@ ord .
the doctor should provide antibiotics to the patient .
as the patient has had a pen@@ sion@@ al aller@@ gy , Mr G@@ ir should allow him to be tested in order to check whether it is be@@ ating the medicine . it is not a pen@@ al point , it is a close woman .
Mr G@@ r@@ ard asked to be a st@@ ron@@ t .
if he had a serious response to the medicine , he would have caused a blow or his blood emphasis would be reduced .
neither did they happen .
that is why it was wa@@ tered down .
a few hours a few hours ago , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was a speech .
the patient &apos;s body temper@@ atures has risen to 39 degrees .
he rus@@ hed the patient to look at the patient .
the patient &apos;s face in the face of the patient &apos;s face , and it was the Roma .
even though he seemed to be aw@@ k@@ ward , he was all in order with her hearts and blood .
it is a good fortu@@ ne that he was using the patient to the patient .
he has asked for another dram@@ a in T@@ y@@ len@@ on and , if he had to look at the last time for the patient , it came deeply .
the fe@@ ver was dropped .
the H@@ ig@@ ine month and the Rom@@ ans were missing .
next night , when G@@ iron@@ ard came to an accident in a hospital infection , the first thing he was doing is the patient .
he has also adopted five other patients , but the patient was concerned at home after his day &apos;s current team .
during these hours , when he did not see him , the labor@@ atory increased his blood body .
it was too early to say what this is more detail .
it was clear , however , that this is a bac@@ teri@@ a , which is robust enough to grow up the Pet@@ r , and that it is not a Sta@@ p@@ h@@ y@@ lo@@ co c@@ c@@ us au@@ x@@ us and L@@ on@@ ds .
the list of other options was long , and none of them actually seen fit .
it took two days before they finally managed to establish the bac@@ teri@@ a .
it was an additional then ac@@ id .
Mr President , like all the others who care for the patient were surprised .
as a medical doctor , pic@@ tures are pic@@ ked up by pic@@ tures .
for G@@ tru@@ ar@@ i there was an additional disease which will be obtained from a passport milk and the che@@ ese milk and which is causing birth rates . what has happened , it has been c@@ rus@@ hed .
he was working on this unusual error in the past and found that , although people with conventional immun@@ e people can experience the symp@@ toms of these symp@@ toms . they usually quickly like the patient &apos;s colleague .
in the case of people who are young , older than 65 and damaged immun@@ e system can be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed in the case of the people who are in the age of 65 , sometimes without the normal ones . without showing the symp@@ toms - and in the process of bloo@@ d@@ shed .
it may be spread across the body , as it was spent .
this type of language , which is called on In@@ ves@@ ted extra products , may end in the case of suff@@ e@@ rers , up to 30 % of cases in cases of suff@@ e@@ rers , up to 30 % of cases . that is the case .
indeed , even though it is not as widespread as bo@@ y , the extra ter could be the same dead@@ ly .
early antibio@@ tic treatment can save life .
when it comes to a problem of food transmission , what food this bac@@ teri@@ a ?
although the patient and his colleague was not a passenger in the summer , and his colleague was not a passenger who was consumed by the Internet in Scotland this summer . the additional outbreak , which was associated with smo@@ ke@@ -free beef .
neither of them has been fed by smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en , but they have a little smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en .
where the bac@@ teri@@ a was pic@@ ked up in exactly where the bac@@ teri@@ a was in no secret .
when the medical team had been aware of the fault of the patient , they were able to adapt antibiotics .
his three-@@ week medical treatment ended in July .
doctors recommended it to finish the summer , but now it feels quite well , and has returned to the mu@@ se@@ um and our bel@@ o@@ ved work .

the Federal Government of the Indian Prime Minister , Mr N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra , has said that he wants to make it easier for religious reasons in India .

Mr Ber@@ ü@@ r@@ k : P@@ Putin over the whole year , so that the leave would not have been needed .
I was , of course , to blame for the rest of this leave .
I was also a somewhat necessary employee , but I believe it is the only one who felt irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
it itself is to blame for a con@@ scienti@@ ous con@@ scienti@@ ous con@@ s .
the quo@@ tation at the beginning of this House is well that it is entirely correct .
that was the case - the new agency , which I started in March , it called for working to work , but nothing to do so much better in the work that I have done so much better in order to me . this is a completely new life for three months , I have just gone out .
today , the time of the summer , the time of time .
it is time to make the latest promises , to see what has happened in life and which is the whole col@@ ours .
after all , this is a Christmas and a year of year , there are now a decent citizen from a bad citizen .
perhaps it is , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas does not fit for thinking and set targets .
well , I will only speak for myself - I will not be able to make any amendment at the time of the year .
this is too difficult for me .
of course , in Christmas , in Christmas , there is good luck and jo@@ y : I like the awareness of the initi@@ alling of the wrong tri@@ ump@@ h , like Christmas &apos;s revenue and also to J@@ obs . the model was a very hear@@ ty warning , a revolu@@ tionary demonstration .
nevertheless , during the Christmas period , I have been very ti@@ red and sometimes stressed - for the dar@@ k@@ ness of the Christmas .
yes , I will be doing a lot of work on holiday , perhaps more , if I do , in the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and I am constantly in time . quite let us quite clear .
for the most part , I have run the c@@ r@@ è@@ ches , the gi@@ ft , at least four Christmas celebra@@ tions , a bit greater burden on the work ...
in view of the un@@ failing social pressure in the heart and peace in the heart of peace , the difficulties of the times of Christmas are obvious .
however , des@@ pair and ti@@ red person will not be able to make good decisions , from the plan to improve them .
such things have to be done with a more or less clear line .
the ti@@ red person is thro@@ wing into the air and a res@@ ounding promise , which will be around the same amount of assistance to the purchase of the future of the future . that is the case .
the promise that is intended to change something , it should be cal@@ mly thought , it should be a plan .
the plan , in contrast to the pledge , there will also be a target for action , and it will not go ahead with a few minor set@@ backs .
that is why I say that the best time for promises of promises is now in the summer .
it is just as high as it is a fa@@ ti@@ gue as high ( as it is ) .
if you do not commit itself in a holiday period , if you do not commit itself in a couple of weeks , to find a few weeks in order to find a few weeks of their lives . the Convention , which is worthy of a bridge , and think about how exactly this has been done .
I think it is important to live as possible so that the rest is not needed to have the rest on , rather than once a year .
so it would be an additional tribute , not a bo@@ x@@ out of the bo@@ x@@ out required for survival , which will be down@@ lo@@ aded so far as to be able to survive . there is no way to oppose the next year .
I would recommend that at least one simple word of a pledge - if you have to rise at a certain time this morning , then in good time .
I believe that , when one in ten members of the Po@@ ear@@ r , the life in Estonia would have a significant improvement in Estonia .
I myself intend to follow the advice of my own .

it would be very good for us to think and draw conclusions .

more generally , however , one might have a strategy that it shares in the social media .
however , at national level , it is necessary to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers of the social media .

it is very difficult to say how long the patient would have been able to live in a new heart &apos; , spoke of the P@@ y@@ der .
the assurance of doctors is now living for the maximum of eight years now .
the man will only recover and is not prepared to talk about this .
he was diagno@@ sed for the first time two years ago , and the disease had already reached the final stage , the lack of heart was caused by the lack of heart .
&apos;@@ this disease was the only option for the disease .
according to Kar@@ di@@ o@@ k@@ ur@@ g , the patient is not in a gu@@ est for the patient after their transplant .
he will be left with many more and immun@@ e conver@@ sion .
the patient can do sport and will live in general as normal person &apos; , he said .
the first year is the most dangerous one .
in the anne@@ x , it will take three to six months to complete recovery .
according to both doctors , the patient must be subject to regular monitoring of the use ; however , the medicines also has its side effects .
in addition , the patient must be in operation , so as to prevent a re@@ sur@@ gence of donor .
the most dangerous is the first year , but the IS@@ H@@ T , International Soci@@ ety for H@@ e@@ ar@@ t and L@@ un@@ g T@@ er@@ n@@ is . according to estimates , 50 % of patients are already living .

&apos;@@ much more took the time to get the pu@@ mp , and then get a gri@@ p when the new heart of &apos; , he said .
in addition , there was a car@@ dio@@ t operation as part of the complex operation of the operation .

there is a difference in terms of accommodation facilities , the prices of the most favoured packages have different times , and the choices are to be found for a more demanding custom@@ er than that . even more hu@@ mble ones , too , with more hu@@ mble ones .
for example , if alone the passenger and receive the 51 of the V@@ lam@@ o@@ di S@@ pa S@@ pa , the S@@ pa S@@ pa S@@ pa . last night and the water par@@ ks , the un@@ restra@@ ined use of the rest of the country and the un@@ restricted du@@ al-@@ use , then compli@@ cit in the name of Mr Mu@@ hu@@ r . there will be a package of EUR 2@@ 87 .
it includes accommodation in the D@@ ou@@ b@@ le D@@ ou@@ b@@ e D@@ el@@ e category , a break@@ fast in the resta@@ ur@@ ant , a break@@ fast in the resta@@ ur@@ ant , and &apos; burden &apos; . and the &apos; half-@@ day &apos; package package &apos; .
in choosing and compared to the various packages , it should be taken into account that , in order to obtain the most favourable price , because in two of them . night is more favourable than the individual .
if , however , there is a desire alone on its own , then it will be offered to a visiting one in accordance with both a special number of one-@@ person smoke as well as for the su@@ per levy . that is the case .
if , in general , the un@@ lo@@ d@@ led travel will have to be paid for their presence in the two cor@@ ners alone , then we will be able to make compromises . also , more favourable options .
in Haiti , for example , in the H@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ at , the package pays EUR 86 to be EUR 86 per month , but it will also be offered a more favourable opportunity in the two to night on condition that , in the event of a shortage of spac@@ es , the custom@@ er will be subject to the custom@@ er .
in this case , the package will have to be estimated at EUR 58 .
flexible in order to be able to be flexible .
the prices of packages are dynamic , in other words , dependent on a week &apos;s own , and it will be .
in the most favourable package , prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 , &apos; was explained at the sale of the V of the G@@ P@@ a@@ a@@ Ho@@ k@@ li - and a market leader in Tri@@ in@@ u , the President of Tri@@ in@@ u .
he has also drawn attention to the fact that in their ho@@ tels , the price is changing , depending on the fin@@ ality , and added that , generally , the custom@@ er is more favourable at the price of the custom@@ er . to put it directly to their website , or by asking themselves .
as the summer period is the fas@@ test for the s@@ car@@ ves , it is worthwhile planning to plan in time to avoid a situation in which the desired place has been sold .
for example , on 11 August of the comparison of the package has been elected on 11 August , S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa S@@ pa and S@@ pa S@@ pa S@@ pa and S@@ pa S@@ pa S@@ pa and S@@ pa S@@ pa and the S@@ pa S@@ pa S@@ pa and S@@ pa . the f@@ xes and also of the La@@ ar@@ land , the Vi@@ hal@@ ves has been sold .
it does not have to look for the a@@ ven@@ t-@@ off a@@ part@@ ment does not have to look for each of the largest Estonia of Estonia , one or even a number of s@@ mi@@ les .
it is worth examining the package before the package , nor does it take a few more events in the vic@@ in@@ ity because it will increase prices right now .
for example , in 11 to 13 August , the Ha@@ ar@@ ca@@ v is taking place in the White campaign .
at that time , Haiti has a lot of tourists , demand for accommodation accommodation , and we will have the price of major events at that time .
&apos;@@ so , we do not have a accommodation of accommodation at a preferential price or favourable pac@@ kets &apos; , commen@@ ted by the S@@ tu@@ a@@ a@@ ho@@ p wave to President I@@ ren@@ e . outside it .

the taking shape is the fact that , if an aero@@ plane is dra@@ gged on by the cold and , at the same time , the gap between the gap between the people and , at the same time , the difference between the differences between the people , and the difference in the different speed . as a result of the st@@ ring@@ ency , one at the moment , this aircraft mas@@ ses and beg@@ ging the whole mass of the air .

it is the right to be taking the lead in a great hur@@ ry , and this , in turn , will take up the &apos; Com@@ prehen@@ sive &apos; base &apos; .
simple after all ?
it is difficult to calcu@@ late the figures .
the aircraft requires a minimum of 15@@ 0-@@ km Irish for the increase in the minimum of 15@@ 0-@@ km Irish , the speed of the global record is now &apos; only &apos; 12@@ 1.@@ 1 . 1 km / h .
however , let us not get bo@@ gged down to physical school !
today , I have looked at the &apos; Catal@@ an &apos; direc@@ tory &apos; , which bears the name of the name of the &apos; C@@ RA@@ F@@ 20 .
the PC@@ R@@ A comes together with the presentation from the Nor@@ th@@ -@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an Ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an , R@@ ac@@ ing As@@ sis@@ o .

this is a system that allows the cre@@ w to set the basis of the &apos; L@@ et &apos; , and 20 also showing a mo@@ ck@@ ery .
as soon as the Catal@@ an compla@@ in@@ ant , it is clear that this is not a gentle@@ man &apos;s P@@ y@@ ha@@ m of Mes@@ men .
Dr Mon@@ o@@ cks and K@@ ar@@ ten S@@ have have been left to the Chamber today .
the Bi@@ p and s@@ las@@ ters were not com@@ pa@@ ired .
this is what it is about .
it is a K@@ Irish in Cuba .
&apos;@@ This is a carbon bel@@ lion ? &apos; I would like to quote the c@@ ool .
yes , it is all about carbon .
&apos;@@ L@@ o &apos;t all over ? &apos; I do not understand it .
&apos;@@ No &apos; not , the whole , sounds like a short answer .
170 kil@@ o - our three who we are going on , we will certainly look at more than 170 shi@@ el@@ ds .
I compare everything to the wh@@ eel@@ s of the was@@ h cars , and it is not here - with the NA@@ C@@ R@@ A , such as those of the street . it would be inappropriate to bre@@ ast .

there is also a lot of security equipment to be dis@@ posed of security equipment , which must be done before the sea .

in L@@ ah@@ al@@ ing , the feeling is that the w@@ light of the w@@ ron@@ gs , and as well as the sea , Mar@@ s@@ si would also have to be colon@@ ised .
&apos;@@ is there a great like@@ lih@@ ood of rever@@ sing ? &apos; I would like to say a jo@@ ke at the time .
&apos;@@ Y@@ es &apos; , sounds short answer .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have gone much around , &apos; S@@ on@@ de@@ li has a lot to do .

in this regard , I confirm the safety night .
Mr Si@@ h@@ to@@ t@@ sta@@ sta@@ ce also highlights the fact that , in the name of N@@ ac@@ ra ph@@ 20 , needs to be dis@@ missed and a minimum of two . the te@@ am@@ ics .

in the autumn of this year , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e marked 7@@ 7 bir@@ th@@ day .
his father was a national official and a mother of M@@ ne lo@@ ved very food .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e learned the university in the university and , as Australia &apos;s young people , went in the past after their studies .
in France travel with Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e travel in France is just an ob@@ session and development .
in London , however , he met his first hus@@ band with Mon@@ t@@ y Mon@@ t@@ o , with whom they have opened in Australia in 196@@ 4 in 196@@ 4 . the &apos; Y@@ on J@@ ama@@ a@@ h Ho@@ w , a simple fe@@ ver in the J@@ ama@@ a@@ h Ho@@ w .
ten years later , a marriage was closed down , and a resta@@ ur@@ ant closed down the doors .
in 197@@ 6 , he already opened a little more aff@@ lu@@ ent to a resta@@ ur@@ ant Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e de R@@ es@@ ta@@ ur@@ ina , which was the next 21 years . the quality of the price of M@@ el@@ bour@@ e@@ t .
the resta@@ ur@@ ant is still being said in the resta@@ ur@@ ant of what is known as the first F@@ ine d@@ in@@ age &apos; , which really can value value . fresh raw materials and also provided a seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be the truth , but it was not yet at the end of the last century .
after the resta@@ ur@@ ant withdrawal from the resta@@ ur@@ ant in 1997 , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e has been concentrated on the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , they have appeared in 15 .
in Estonia , there has not been simply a reci@@ pe for publi@@ city in Estonia , but in his case , no book has been simply a reci@@ pe for prescription .

the book was apparent for the first time in 1996 , improved publication in 2004 and the latest version in 2014 .
in my libr@@ ary , it will take up quite a lot of room for this in 2004 , because he is about a thousand of the reci@@ pes in the im@@ pos@@ ter@@ n@@ ous book .
however , the latest option is even greater .

food is a f@@ esti@@ val order , as well as there are many cross-@@ references in the works - obviously , the education of the libr@@ ary education in the boo@@ m of the libr@@ ary .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e itself stresses that it was precisely this piece of paper that has changed his life and given the new direction for the future .
the feeling that the popular paper comes from popular , that it has something to the people , the project for the next major , vegetables , which are comparable in our circumstances .
Mrs M@@ US@@ S M@@ ä@@ re@@ g : the preparation has not been quite the way , as I have seen in the past .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou has not everything that has been the case , as I was speaking in my spiri@@ tu@@ ous I was talking about M@@ ili@@ g M@@ M .
the Re@@ e@@ de@@ l-@@ Saturday are important elements showing how bad it is .
and competition shows that , in any case , what we are doing here .
today , I believe that my preparation has been of high quality , both this year and in previous years , so that it is possible to run on a normal life .
something special has not been dealt with by the Est@@ onian , 13@@ .@@ 05 , the start of the day after their home champi@@ ons .
in recent weeks , tra@@ ces are often carried out in the last few weeks .
there should be , and may be very useful to have the last M@@ M@@ -@@ last week was a bit easy .
on the physical side , we are going to go on to the physical side : yesterday , today , the war@@ mer trend is doing a war@@ mer trend .
however , in his spiri@@ tual preparation , he does not want to be very gu@@ ilt : &apos; I have a time of stu@@ p@@ id .
there is a lot of silence and peace , and no rosé music to their own e@@ ars .
I do not need to look at any incentive vi@@ de@@ o@@ x@@ s or read in suicide , but to be present here and at this time , to evaluate the possibility of evaluating that the world has come across the world . a@@ th@@ le@@ tes together , in one place , to compare their abilities .
this , in itself , is a source of diversity .
what is more , of course , is a year of excellence for each time , and this is one of which each of the initial sta@@ rs , but also the competition in T@@ emis@@ tan@@ y . it has taken up some of the technical nu@@ ances , compared with some of the competi@@ tions .
there is no room for an experim@@ en@@ tation of experim@@ en@@ tation has no longer been an experim@@ en@@ tation .
&apos;@@ W@@ here is just to run quickly &apos; , says a few , but add that if the previous cl@@ out and potentially also in the qu@@ an@@ fin@@ al way , and potentially in the qu@@ est , will be successful in the qu@@ est . a percentage or a few energy storage , then they will certainly benefit from the next drin@@ k@@ ness .
for the first time , the Central party goes to the elections as the foun@@ der of a party and an ideological one .
so far , we said in the Middle East and we were thinking of the Sa@@ ar@@ ar@@ r , or vice vers@@ a .
it is now up to the Central party to find the way forward .
in so doing , they must also be allowed by the col@@ ours of the party &apos;s col@@ our@@ ful and embarras@@ sing past , Sa@@ du@@ ans and the voters . sometimes .
the issue of leaving the Central Bank makes the most difficult situation in the most complex situation of the Central party .
on the basis of the current political practice and ideology , it can be said that it is playing an old n@@ in@@ y@@ vi@@ ch .
many of the cards that , in the past , the effects of the past , may not become a reality this time .
P@@ op@@ ul@@ is@@ m@@ scheme for the Central Bank , because it will always be more permitted than the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister .
playing the Russian card has been made more difficult , both for the government in the government and , therefore , that here too , we see how the so-called &apos; Sa@@ v@@ ene@@ o@@ va election &apos; for the northern gas . it will be .
as a result of the ongoing court process , as a result of the ongoing court process .
for the Central party , the P@@ R@@ D and the poor are also missing .
the first of these is its un@@ de@@ vo@@ id of value , and the other is that the coalition partners in the government are blocking it .
however , one card may be even more serious .
all the last elections have confirmed that these parties , who are able to formulate the basic pillars of the elections and then implement it .
the S@@ ain@@ t , the main on@@ ph@@ et@@ t has just around Sa@@ pu@@ er@@ are .
if some political parties should develop a good idea of a well-@@ functioning confron@@ ta@@ le of life for the rest of the political party is missing again from the map of the Central party .
what will be left to the Central parties ?
a strong part@@ is@@ an and significant resource they still have .
also enough is enough in the run-up to the elections .
in four years ago , the de@@ priva@@ tion from the taxpayer of four years ago .
there is no way out of the city of T@@ all@@ an@@ na , but the freedom of the part@@ is@@ an press has remained less .
in addition , the party has its voice .
their role will be to be ex@@ tra@@ di@@ cated at this time , because the image of the power party is not enough to moti@@ vate the electorate .
in ideological terms , the Y@@ ü@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ s must find its way , because the road was brought to an end to this week .

the most stu@@ p@@ id questions that we put to the ba@@ r .
the Hu@@ ff Po@@ st is preparing the head@@ lines of basic elements that they would not like to hear .
what are you doing best about what drin@@ k ?
in some drin@@ k , there are indeed more ingredients than in the other , but they are going to be required to prepare them .
it is often interpreted as a &apos; M@@ East is now the most easy / fas@@ test for the most easy / fas@@ test for them ? &apos; , which gives them a signal that the custom@@ er will be interpreted by the custom@@ er . there is no matter what he drin@@ ks , prepare for it to be difficult for the ba@@ r .
what drin@@ k you are most like to do ?
this issue is being interpreted in the same way as to what a lot of the world is now getting the most difficult thing out of the ba@@ r .
this is not a matter for a ba@@ r , but the custom@@ er makes decisions on their own pur@@ se .
rather , rather than waiting for the basic elements of whether there are no special offers at present .
what is the good being offered ?
perhaps this question is the desire to find out whether the ba@@ r priva@@ ces with any offer of others , but it could also be asked in any other ways , but it could also be asked to ask .
nor can you imagine what the custom@@ er could be given to the custom@@ er .
could I have a drin@@ k that would not be very mai@@ ze ?
here , like the previous rule , that a ba@@ ar@@ r in you are not familiar with their priorities , and which is not the case for one ; it does not necessarily have it for others . to be .
however , it is ready to listen to what kind of desirable co@@ ff@@ ers could be included .
is this drin@@ k brings me to me a hea@@ vi@@ che / po@@ son ?
the media are neither a media nor a pre@@ dicta@@ bility , that the custom@@ er is to promise the custom@@ er .

women often feel that it is unable to enjoy the &apos; normal &apos; cycle cycle at the end of the &apos; conventional &apos; cycle , when it is known that the positive outcome does not come .

milk , too , is not an easy piece of pic@@ tures , because it may not be seen as white at all .

because , for example , in the morning &apos;s calls for milk to be seen in the l@@ are and are s@@ car@@ ding , instead of milk , instead of which are not left to the east . after all , no call .
if resta@@ ur@@ ants can make a lot of effort to prepare meat , that the outcome would be the volume of the ba@@ r , by advertising it is not being done .
however , the meat which has been presented in advertising is a particularly attractive one , as if they have come directly from the g@@ ri@@ l@@ la .
often , however , it is ready to put a ban@@ ner , or it is pul@@ led to meat g@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ e are pul@@ led apart from c@@ ron@@ ies . you have a gri@@ p .

if you were seen as an ideal advertising in advertising , where the relationship is perfect , it has apparently been used to some additional la@@ yers . you have had a piece of paper or paper .
this is because the code may well be dis@@ per@@ sed , and the picture of the ru@@ in .
if , after the paragraph , the code would be put in place , and s@@ pra@@ ying them with an addition , it makes it difficult to give a great deal of impression .
it is also used within the C@@ ar , so that all the ingredients there will be in place , that all the ingredients there will be precisely in place , so that these were a beautiful place .

it is well known : how many are sugar in milk products ?
the European Union &apos;s food labelling standards can be set out on the packaging and the quantity of sugar bas@@ es , which do not equ@@ ate , however , by no means of a white , so-called &apos; des@@ k &apos; . there was a c@@ ry of the P@@ r@@ r@@ h@@ u , the director of V@@ ali@@ o Kal@@ b@@ in .
as he said , there are three types of sugar in milk products : the end of the milk in the milk sector , in other words , natural milk . in the f@@ ru@@ ins and has been included in a communication , which is also included in the ch@@ ha@@ p .
if , however , we should not keep in mind a few simple reasons , Mr Kal@@ b@@ ini says that the amount of sugar that has been included in the manufacture of sugar , which is included in the Kal@@ b@@ in .
first of all , it must be made clear whether this is milk or ha@@ p@@ ted milk products .
in the normal milk and in milk products are included in the normal milk and milk product , in other words , c@@ at 100 grams per product .
in the milk products , there has been a stop to the lit@@ mus test for the w@@ oods in the course of the w@@ ound process , in the course of the w@@ ound process . that is why , on average , there is an average of 3.@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g per product .
the first to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar is the first to calcu@@ late the total sugar of sugar is the result of the total of sugar .
we now need to calcu@@ late the quantities of the mar@@ ches and fer@@ ries .
&apos;@@ S@@ generally is a f@@ et@@ ch@@ product and the g@@ ä@@ n@@ der in the milk products and , in particular , 0.@@ 3 grams and particularly mar@@ ch in the event of crop content and particularly mar@@ ch . by re@@ producing 15 % of up to 1.5 grams of 100 grams per hundred grams &apos; , the Kal@@ b@@ in was saying .
he says that this shows a simple calculation that the proportion of sugar added may be the percentage of sugar in the mar@@ ch of mar@@ ches up up to twice as much as the sugar proportion indicated on the packaging .
in the case of L@@ ak@@ si@@ -@@ free products , the situation is slightly different because , in their case , the sugar content is dependent on production technology .

why have the do@@ gs appear ?
it is sometimes thought that the do@@ g is to eat , if he does not feel well and wants to put it up to it .
in fact , most of the abun@@ dan@@ t co@@ ff@@ ers are completely healthy .
only less than 10 per cent of the do@@ gs who appear to appear in some diseases .
one of the reasons why the do@@ g may well start to eat , can be nutri@@ ent food sto@@ res .
these do@@ gs , who have believed , may have a greater interest in the face of the face .
so , when the House , who has not been b@@ ligh@@ ten in the past , is the up@@ shot of the m@@ ud , he is often de@@ serving of it , is de@@ serving to be worthwhile in any case . to carry out control , for example , in order to get a problem of the possible problems of this kind of disaster .
it is worth pointing out that the do@@ g may be an innocent because he like her tas@@ te , or it is simply fore@@ ver .
if the health problem has been ruled out , it would be worth identifying that the family will continue to be sufficiently developed and desperate .

in actual fact , I did not pay the closest attention to the threshold of the first hand .
I have put in motion as a machine .
the &apos; two small children &apos; e@@ ars &apos; from the top of the &apos; two small children &apos; .
when the second la@@ y@@ light and I started to was@@ h , it was still a b@@ right of was@@ hing the b@@ light . there will be a tre@@ e and found there then .
the age of a man of gold has been gra@@ ded 14 years ago .
as someone in a family called a man or woman , who could be in hel@@ ple@@ ssly , there is no complete my@@ ster@@ ling to some of them .
Mrs K@@ in rese@@ ar@@ ched the parent &apos;s child , that perhaps his hor@@ ror has been in the po@@ cket and the war@@ r@@ r@@ ho@@ in has been put into the was@@ h . in fact , the child confirmed that he has not brought home home .
Kar@@ in is a year for my partners in T@@ all@@ in@@ n M@@ ad@@ al@@ i , has lived for a year .
in the past , they come out of it and then then it is a was@@ hing machine .
but , when a friend , should there be nothing to do with the inf@@ er@@ ons , how does it get into operation ?
&apos;@@ We are now in a demanding and cannot understand the path that was needed to was@@ h into the was@@ h machine &apos; .
since the rate of life in two small children is quite rapid , then in the dre@@ ams at the end of the day .
&apos;@@ recently , there have been postal ma@@ ps , where the holder of the holder of the age of living , and now it seemed that it is high time for us to look for the screening that we have found ourselves . the &apos; , K@@ la@@ in refers to a case in the social media , where in T@@ all@@ in@@ n &apos;s outbreak last week in T@@ all@@ in@@ n . it was .
&apos;@@ because F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k will be found and se@@ ar@@ ched for different things , I was first first to try to try &apos; speaking &apos; , Mr Kar@@ in , whose post has divided up . nearly 4 000 people .
&apos;@@ Po@@ t has now received any feedback , and not everything is good &apos; , a woman , referring that he would recommend that he had his or her man . to take the floor .
then there was the feeling that it was now necessary .
since my me@@ ch has become the biggest dece@@ it and we have heard .
frankly , at the beginning , I have been concerned at the beginning , but , when the comments came to the comments that I am going to have , in all honesty , in time . I am laugh@@ ing .
the com@@ posi@@ tes also proposed the idea that maybe the screening has reached the second circle in the pockets of ri@@ gs .
well , the last six months ago , the work was bought in work for work in the work of the second circle , which were flying without more in-depth study without more in-depth in@@ quiries . it is true , but is it really a woman who is discussing her .
be that as it may , however , we have agreed that it is now already a principle that we now need to find the ow@@ ner .
let us be the reason for the disappearance of this screening .
divorce , a family family or whatever .
I think that this is the only thing , because if I had ever had to disappear , I know I would be very grateful to the person who tried me . it is to be found and a valuable asset to return .
I have also approached the role of the family situation in order to obtain aid from the ow@@ ner .
however , I received the answer that in Estonia on this date and that is what he has done .
one screening is the ow@@ ner .

from time to time , we still have to go to the forest , whatever the reason .
however , if , however , the qu@@ est is the time to make a single cu@@ le of roads .
there are plenty of resources for this .
the protection of the home is a little overview .
we are talking about this because we are talking about it , and quite the way , which is , to some extent , a pat@@ ch@@ work , but it is not our case . the best for health .
it is always prepared to be an attempt to test , because both the prescri@@ ptions and mai@@ ze are different .
some of them are not needed for a long time , only six of them will only have to leave the others , on the other hand , have to be drawn up .
of course , there must also be an observation that water and plants are sufficiently clean .
it also depends on a great deal of time and of the time and place .
we will now take a closer look at how to prepare a few simple roads and what influence they may have .
M@@ h@@ ni@@ y@@ k@@ el@@ o@@ k@@ ro@@ sis
M@@ k@@ ni@@ k@@ ar@@ ways can be a friend of a year ago .
if a day is a good thing of God &apos;s water per day , it su@@ its the way well , in order to satisfy the need for the C@@ -@@ vita@@ min@@ s and to give a little extra . energy .
as for all plants , it is also possible to get useful elements in the use of alternative methods , for example , by d@@ aring - o@@ cks do not have to take a long time . it is enough to have a bul@@ let of water and , for a while , the dra@@ g .
a half lit@@ res of water per li@@ tre of water per li@@ tre of water , which has to be run for 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k in which there is almost 25 m@@ g of C@@ -@@ vita@@ mines , a great deal of c@@ ali@@ um and nothing .
in addition , drin@@ k contains some of the 1.5 sugar k@@ u@@ p , in other words , the 20 c@@ at sugar .
there can always be a res@@ che@@ on in order to improve the brain &apos;s .
and if a drin@@ k received a can@@ ge , it may be wa@@ tered down as a transplant .
the preparation of Cuba is in the same way , but drin@@ k goes a bit differently .
the V@@ ar wait is excellent and it will help very many s@@ cour@@ ges , in the cor@@ ner of a huge number of s@@ cour@@ ges .
a fa@@ ti@@ gue will help to overcome the fa@@ ti@@ gue process , and will help in the event of col@@ dest diseases , as well as as a catalyst for sa@@ va@@ ge disease , as well as in the case of cold diseases . the down@@ ward trend .
as a result , it would not be worth half a half a per day .
it is also waiting for a sense of dis@@ covering , so winter should be found a more peaceful moment for this return .
in the winter to prepare the winter , we will take fresh car@@ cas@@ the@@ es at the time of the summer , the equivalent or a mar@@ ch .
for half a li@@ tre , a little bit of a little bit of the par@@ alle@@ ls that have to be seen as long as water ow@@ es the red b@@ ag@@ on . that is the case .
the V@@ ar the@@ ft can also be made .
to this end the the@@ ft and the ho@@ to them for a few hours in the heat .
a longer , and more comprehensive work , is also doing the chic@@ ken .
we are prepared to have a car@@ b@@ on-@@ let to include the games in the b@@ ric@@ s .
Mus@@ t@@ c@@ k@@ el@@ s
the Mus@@ t@@ ta@@ que is a disability which , in nature , looks like a piece of piece of trees .
in most cases , there are the same benefits , but elsewhere .
the Se@@ ine area is very wide - as a bul@@ let , for inno@@ c@@ ence , instead of the virus , and so on .
the ash can also be very poor .
a kind of &apos; super@@ market &apos; is a kind of super@@ market which can be used for a great many diseases , even cancer or minor , to raise the tone . to reduce the stress , prolon@@ ging life expectancy .
the Se@@ en contains a number of unique comp@@ ounds and a lot of B@@ -@@ vita@@ mines , as well as anti-@@ o@@ ils and a few min@@ eral and white .
the route made in Se@@ en@@ es can be the case of a day , there is no risk of over-@@ consumption .
there is a need for around 3 to 3 c@@ enti@@ m a piece of five to 15 have been run in 2-@@ 3 lit@@ res , between 5 and 15 minutes .
a woman wal@@ ks around the earth : my day budget is USD 5 .
I have had this experience of honour , I have also had this experience of 40 days , in which I have chosen to live in southern France , in order to simply be free and live a day . at the same time .
the scen@@ es have been taken in the scen@@ es , forests , small towns and so on .
in one of the French &apos; hom@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness &apos; , 44 years old .
O@@ i , do not think there was some sort of pe@@ de@@ stri@@ des : Mr Ö@@ ö@@ cure was simply in M@@ en@@ ton , and we were able to get friends in M@@ en@@ ton and we were able to friends . although it was a 15@@ a parent , it was a good thing .
it came out that the man was a good family , a former French officer officer .
Al@@ co@@ t is not wise , the sun is not doing , in a word , a decent person , an intelligent , pleasant relationship and , life .
the united , I was in and will be followed by 3 weeks , together with the city of the city , the city of the town and also around 5 per day .
the money has still come , so much for the lives .
the man taught how the contribution of the evening to provide assistance to the closure of ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ants of resta@@ ur@@ ants and resta@@ ur@@ ants .
we have done a lot of work to be followed by 2 and 3 days , and then on ...
at some point in time , I have decided that no longer should be allowed ...
I took the flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki from home .
and , incidentally , I regret .
these 40 days were perhaps the best of my life .
Mr F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k has referred to F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : &apos; the quo@@ tation is a poor justification &apos; .
therefore , I am not going to look back and try to remember what has been done in the history of human creation and what results have been achieved .
I am not going to judge whether these tests can be seen as successful or failed .
I will also avoid the excessive sources , although in the image of my most important teacher in Rome : all of my thoughts have been . it is borro@@ w@@ ers to remember where exactly .
the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ ating of the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ ation of the citizens of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect person .
we are not going to grow , as we are growing children , in good faith , that it becomes a person .
we are going to increase him in this way , as the ruling class , is to say that he can live in Estonia and speak out in Estonia .
censorship is perfect .
although the local ruling class changed was a bit of a year ago , some farming methods are equally frigh@@ tening when the previous ruling class , now impover@@ ished lo@@ vers - their bru@@ tality . it is not a little bit down to the previous previous .
they are simply different .
Latvia &apos;s shoul@@ ders are the br@@ ink of a new era .
to the Heads of State of the State
the ruling class is not only those politicians who are receiving their salary from the state , but also those of those who are making a voluntary policy on a voluntary basis ( lo@@ e : deliberately ) in writing . - ( PT ) Mr Mik@@ hail , in using an opinion flag , F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , when the terrible people are be@@ having around them . in Estonia , it is going to be a boycot@@ t , the gesture of sa@@ b@@ o@@ tage .
they are in agreement with the EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber in EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber &apos; ( English ) for people who live in a space where there is only the right opinions for them , for example . their own F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k friends , etc . ) , but the conflict in Estonia is not possible .
there are still some of the compli@@ ments , who thinks or is doing something that is un@@ be@@ arable of the co@@ war@@ di@@ ce .
and that is the wording of the wor@@ ship and business sh@@ ell@@ s are dra@@ con@@ ian .
we have a very number of politicians who know exactly how much a person can go on with a number of children , about how to work . a great deal of pay is when he is going to be on , what to think about how to divorce , when we may have a death .
very important positions .
when their public contributions have anything other than what they have said themselves are insul@@ ted , insul@@ ted , hy@@ ste@@ ria .
the fact that in several countries in Europe , people travel in several European countries , and this is allowed by law , is not s@@ hak@@ en .
zero tolerance is the only permitted mes@@ s in every area , but there is no care behind zero tolerance , but by fear .
class hatred and fat - just as much like me .
the politicians will only be able to open the door , but never mind .
they believe that any &apos; action &apos; in which they improve society will work and are well worth trying .
fortunately , we have an adequate size of the glass of K@@ la@@ di@@ ches , the glass of men@@ tality with mental disability , who is a good p@@ in . it is through any window of pain - without pain .
for this reason , it seems to us , if some smart po@@ et is opening up and he is an emo@@ tive error in the winter that this is what it is about . sensible .
a few words , which we will certainly send us as a matter of action , a woman , a woman , violence , the work of the work .
if you believe everything that self-@@ interest officials , activists and politicians ( such are only a small part of all groups , but they are able to depri@@ ve them of the way that they are able to do so . the whole of society is dis@@ posed of and writing ) , the citizen is not only a response , a v@@ ul@@ gar and un@@ pleasant , but also the brain free , without ne@@ eding .
but let us not believe , do not be tole@@ rant , do not ban drinking .
the Est@@ onian people in any case is as much as it wants , not as much as the country is allowing .
the Est@@ onian man is tole@@ rant in any case than it is not forced to be tolerated .
the person of Estonia will not only change its behaviour two months before the elections , in order to ensure that the objective of achieving the objective of his popul@@ arity , and once again , not only . but also to do what un@@ pleasant brain fra@@ tan@@ es are restored rapidly .
who is no different , it is not the right old .
I do not believe that a single person can be re@@ medi@@ ed .
I believe that a person can be taught .
drin@@ k sensi@@ bly , love their own family , to be a man of work , a cour@@ te@@ sy , not only to friends , but for the whole of society .
there is no time for teaching , limit , ban , coer@@ ci@@ on , coer@@ ci@@ on , coer@@ ci@@ on , to put in order to order , to put it into a cor@@ ner of the media . what we are doing .
the teacher must serve as an example .
a politician is talking about tobacco losses ?
at a time , a police officer , makes me a fine fine for exceeding the speed ?
and then there will be a word between my colleague ...
I have this ri@@ tual idea that perhaps we should try to bring the ruling class once again .
to tell them that do not drin@@ k .
you drin@@ k , drin@@ k openly : in the Chamber of the Chamber , the eyes of the people .
the radi@@ ation of the radi@@ ation only publicly - cars , private cars , be all the red .
if you govern , then govern as you govern itself .
perhaps it is a shame , if words and actions are not going together .
or we can know that we ourselves want to be governed by the most sin@@ s .
since all of us , we have the kind of things that we do not want to be at all .
where do we escape from themselves ?
for this weekend , ra@@ ins are allowed to appear , so it would be time to take a proper line .
why not the tri@@ mb@@ ers !
Mr R@@ E g@@ or@@ b@@ ou@@ s shares recommendations for nine habits , which should help the summer to achieve a more hu@@ mble and a better tone . that is the case .
admittedly , the first change should be seen as the first trends in the first trend .
the bus driver saved eight months from the economy , without knowing that the do@@ gs have actually the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat will these eight months , I would be a woman , together with co@@ ff@@ ers , a jo@@ ke of the bus and leader of the bus of coach . who saved the motor@@ way out of the way the way the way to follow the way in hand , by giving them more to the workers of asylum .
however , the property of the home of do@@ gs , for whom it remained un@@ reasonable , why was not taken away from his home .
Mr O@@ le@@ g , the President of Har@@ har@@ land bus and said that he has already been working as a coach man@@ ager from the beginning of the early 1990s , but such a case has not been before in his career . I was travelling by bus and coach by bus and coach .
in close proximity , I have noticed that the road is running around a little .
I thought it was a hand of hand , but it came out that there was four months &apos; , a bus leader was recalled .
he went to bul@@ l , and he stopped passengers full of buses , so as to compensate passengers .
&apos;@@ whereas cars have been travelling by the cars and do@@ gs have been hi@@ jac@@ ked and do@@ gs in the &apos; , in the words of O@@ le@@ g .
he added that the passengers were sensible , and they were also given to them a lot of jo@@ y .
K@@ u@@ wait was a bit of a poor but then changed .
people on board , the coach man@@ ager went on a new front because the vehicle needed compliance .
at the same time , there were still four small do@@ gs there , at the same time , four small do@@ gs .
it was a German lam@@ b of sheep .
they were so na@@ ï@@ ve and it was clear to see that they have been taken care .
do@@ gs were nice , indeed sta@@ ggering .
the first idea was , of course , that someone wanted to get rid of them &apos; , the bus driver spoke that it was for this reason that he decided that it was for this reason that he decided that it was for this reason .
&apos;@@ I also took the four months and called on the police &apos; , we have reminded the police &apos; .
those who have been conta@@ cted by the T@@ all@@ in@@ n , animal protection , which the worker came to the d@@ wel@@ lers of the Baltic .
but was the bus driver not being temp@@ ted to take on board ?
that was the point .
one of the House was both beautiful and calm .
it was fine , as a adult do@@ g , said O@@ le@@ g .
but where are these eight months ?
I would have taken a cor@@ ner with co@@ ff@@ ers , together with the House .
we still have a small child .
property has yet to be taken in the anne@@ x .
in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , the President of the F@@ i@@ ine To@@ bi@@ as confirmed that a shel@@ ter of 8 German sheep co@@ ff@@ ers , who is the two and a half month . the old .
however , on the same day , the ow@@ ner came to the family .
&apos;@@ We did not even make them in the past and gave them just back &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ C@@ er@@ te ow@@ ner was not very ang@@ ry , but he said that they have the only way to see a house &apos;s vision and a driver who could have been asked to ask . did the pro@@ p@@ b belong to them &apos; , spoke about To@@ bi@@ as .
however , the person of asylum in the anne@@ x , however , it is a good thing that the coach man@@ ager , at the same time , and this was not an accident . that is the case .
in fact , it was very good that it has reacted .
in the landscape , it has met where , if necessary , with the best will , the best will not be possible .
that is where the A@@ TV is the solution .
in the case of A@@ T@@ D , which is used in military affairs , gave an overview of the home of the Catal@@ an .
there is nothing new in the use of vehicles in military structures , there is nothing new .
however , the need for them emerged during the Second World War , greater attention was given to them at the end of the Second World War .
simpli@@ city and strength
M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 - M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 - M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 - have already been known as M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 - have already known as M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 - on the way forward . since the end of the Second World War , a vehicle for eva@@ cu@@ ated from the Second World War .
it is a bit strange to say a bit strange to mention the mechan@@ ic truth .
it is hard to imagine the whe@@ el .
a wh@@ eel@@ chair , a platform and a ro@@ ck : everything , the whole luxury .
as far as the species of the construction of the engine@@ ers are too has@@ ty to put on the table and have started to produce cuts .
however , in the war , it counts much more per@@ sever@@ ance .
this categor@@ isation of the slu@@ dge in the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese j@@ ung@@ le .
in V@@ ae@@ va@@ va@@ ly access , less than a fif@@ ty kil@@ o@@ gra@@ m machine , where , in its capacity , in places where our capacity for super@@ flu@@ ence . the my@@ th@@ ological months have gathered in W@@ ill@@ y@@ al Y@@ e@@ p , the brak@@ es had to show .
in the most part of the 5@@ 0-@@ 50 kil@@ o@@ o@@ s of transport on transport , both po@@ p@@ pi@@ a and a revi@@ val of recovery .
sometimes , it was once again being f@@ itted with a fa@@ ke , un@@ set@@ tling anti-@@ tan@@ k weapons .
it was under fire , however , and this has happened , it was possible to shift the ro@@ ol@@ ing system above the ro@@ ol@@ ing system and let it allow it so much . the low that the vehicle was able to lead a ch@@ as@@ p in sheep .
M@@ news was produced up to up to 19@@ 70 , in total of 11 2@@ 40 , and they were in the army up up up to the year up to 19@@ 80 , when the tri@@ ump@@ h of progress was ex@@ changed . the H@@ M@@ M@@ W has done .
in the course of the two decades , A@@ T@@ V@@ s have had a marg@@ inal sense in the military cir@@ cles .
back to the pic@@ tures came after the deser@@ t in New York and the US soldiers found themselves in Iraq and the US soldiers found themselves in the deser@@ t of Iraq and Afghanistan . we are drawing up .
it was where knowledge and the notion that there is a need for something that would fill the gap between H@@ um@@ we@@ e and sho@@ es .
since the A@@ T@@ V@@ s generally takes account of the protection of protection , they are not directly the best option to carry out the battle .
however , it is appropriate rapid and easy mach@@ ines for the special tasks .
for example , in the cas@@ tor and rescue operations , for example .
today , there are thousands of A@@ T@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ .
most of them , such as the so-called X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50 , which was referred to in the so-called X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 5@@ t , which was carried out in accordance with the army &apos;s needs .
on the labelling of the F@@ la@@ r , the names of the K@@ aw@@ as@@ ak@@ i , the names such as K@@ aw@@ as@@ ak@@ i , Mr Mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ dt . c@@ he@@ r and Mr F@@ o@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ ah@@ s R@@ hon@@ o and Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c C@@ at , and an ever-@@ wid@@ ening choice of military A@@ T@@ V@@ Europe . the models of the manufacturer Pol@@ y@@ ar@@ te .
in 2013 , the Centre for a five-year agreement with the Centre of the American special troops ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) in the Pol@@ ar@@ dro@@ i . in terms of supply and a special five-year agreement on the autonomous Pol@@ ar@@ a@@ i S@@ por@@ por@@ man , which has been made by M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 , which has both information . ra@@ pi@@ p@@ tic and innovative bees of bees , which will ensure mobility of mobility for bees , which will ensure mobility of mobility for the bee , which will ensure mobility of movement also . after the horse of the 5@@ 0-@@ speaking Ar@@ om@@ ic Ar@@ med weapons .
before the M@@ 8@@ 50 market lights , the Pol@@ ar@@ ns came from the Pol@@ ar@@ ns from M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 .
in the case of M@@ 700 , there are 7@@ 00@@ c@@ c T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ at@@ man &apos;s military version , which has been included in the case of M@@ v@@ in S@@ port T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ at@@ man . and wants to make , two parts of the fuel tan@@ ks to go through major distan@@ ces , a strengthened ra@@ m and a piece of military equipment for farmers . it is no longer than those who are compla@@ ining to greater .
in the same way , alongside the Pol@@ ar@@ ise A@@ T@@ V@@ s , both in Iraq and in Afghanistan , it is equipped with arms assets , b@@ agg@@ age . with the res@@ c@@ tor and some other elements that have been used in rigour , but in the battle zone .
the vehicle weigh@@ ing up 750 k@@ g can take advantage of almost its own body weight , in particular , the 5@@ 70 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ts .
the driver &apos;s capacity will also suff@@ ice to be able to carry out ligh@@ ter .
as other as other , the aspects of which are dis@@ posed , allows for a vehicle from point B , which is the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of that small . but a little bit of the hard tre@@ e .
later , the M@@ -@@ G@@ G will also prepare versions of A@@ 1 , which is 20 hor@@ ses by 20 hor@@ ses are more powerful than the original 20-@@ hor@@ b@@ el@@ tic M@@ -@@ . G@@ ab@@ a , and the strengthened framework for A@@ 2 , which is even better able to transport and to rest , and A@@ 3 , which is connected with the United States and A@@ 3 . the positive characteristics of A@@ 2 .
indeed , M@@ -@@ G@@ men , in fact , already in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia , where medical bri@@ ga@@ des were used to eva@@ cu@@ ate them .
at the same time , they were also reduced the burden on their own feet , by denying them the ta@@ le that would otherwise have had to come out of the market .
if the majority in the power of the structures in force in force in power structures , there are also a few exceptions .
the emin@@ ent of these emin@@ ent of P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International International , has been used in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International , which has been used successfully throughout the world . the battle , intelligence and rescue missions .
the producer claims for the first time , ten years ago , has been presented for the first time ten years ago , which are characteristic of the traditional A@@ T@@ V@@ Europe . for those , as well as those that the army is mo@@ di@@ cated , both the leadership , re@@ sili@@ ence and safety , as well as in terms of safety .
as a construction and the fourth largest , similar to the usual A@@ T@@ V@@ on , Pro@@ v@@ ler is different from both its construction and its capacity .
it will be quicker , more robust , more stable and can be able to dra@@ g greater difficulties than others similar vehicles .
for example , in the case of the A@@ T@@ V , the driver has to play its own body with their own body , and to use both hands , to speed up , speed and brak@@ ing both hands . it is similar to the leadership of the car rather than a car leadership .
however , at the end of the day , Mr Ford , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or another A@@ T@@ V or U@@ TV , the concept and the scope of the A@@ T@@ R or U@@ TV , the concept and the scope of the sector are the field of application . everyone is similar .
and it is clear that , in the circumstances in which defence expenditure broadly cut down the reduction in defence spending , and the vast majority of the National War , a firm target of a firm target . it is a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the process , is the ligh@@ t-@@ weigh@@ ted army , or to stay in the service of the service .
&apos;@@ my clo@@ ck was killed , but I do not &apos; , we were kept on the front of Mr E@@ . H@@ G@@ E@@ . we are a dam in the S@@ S@@ S@@ dam . a broad s@@ mi@@ le .
it is true , as a whole , a healthy , long-standing tri@@ ump@@ h in R@@ ai@@ vo@@ s .
what is more , in drin@@ k 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres , he had his conver@@ sa@@ tions : &apos; I was talking about one person at the time of drin@@ k . it was &apos; No &apos; and won@@ dered : &apos; I@@ ss@@ it , you were also talking about &apos;
J@@ oo@@ il@@ les went on the Ra@@ iv@@ o , who had energy for the sake , some of the times on the speed of the day .
the T@@ re@@ en@@ er@@ i recommendation .
&apos;@@ A@@ in A@@ h@@ ans@@ t has said that there is no point in putting in place , because there is no point in putting up the wh@@ eel@@ s , because there are such increases here . in time , there is no differenti@@ ation between whether drin@@ ks or the way in the ra@@ cks , &apos; says to say , that it took the lead and consul@@ tan@@ cy . just to hear words .
he was also able to pull the price of the times , and it was also able to over@@ see the left of the left and better inter@@ views . the p@@ he@@ ges .
as is not the case of 1.@@ 9 km of the flood , 90 kilometres of cy@@ c@@ ling and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres to drin@@ k .
&apos;@@ I think that my tre@@ promise is also that I am able to enjoy this competition &apos; in January , in January , and today its body &apos;s body . the 16 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s lost on the Ra@@ ven@@ o , with dis@@ satisfaction .
and as far as inter@@ views are concerned , that is what I would like to say , after the fin@@ ishing inter@@ inter@@ view after the fin@@ ishing .
I have been able to give an inter@@ view to this , and I hoped that it would be good for the German to do so after the O@@ pen I@@ ron .
I thought it would then be all well if I am not in the west of the west of the West &apos; ; on the contrary , the pe@@ la@@ -@@ be@@ on the west of the West . the fin@@ ishing line was offered by the fin@@ ishing line , quite apart from the fin@@ ishing line : our hands in the sky and in the form of a sincere victory .
there were also reasons for this : the Mo@@ vo@@ gu@@ s took 46 minutes for the flood of 46 minutes , and 24 seconds , 90 kilometres of the wh@@ eel@@ s for 3 hours and 32 minutes . 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres to run 2 hours and 18 minutes .
&apos;@@ my heart is now the &apos; my heart &apos; , confirms the Ra@@ iv@@ o , who is already in the fin@@ ing in saying that he had a finger on sport . and it took the finger on the tax@@ i .
I have already registered myself on 20 August with G@@ on@@ ds - 2@@ 30 kilometres of T@@ all@@ in T@@ all@@ in@@ n .
so , once again , I am going to be true tomorrow .
the third f@@ esti@@ val day is a strong wind .
so that was left by the pic@@ tures of the pic@@ tures of the cam@@ er@@ as , one who is trying to fly in the face of the ro@@ of .
many of the f@@ esti@@ vals of this House , many of the f@@ esti@@ vals , that you have your eyes and our eyes .
I think we have gone quite well .
we have done well with our works and our work well with our works and our work , the P@@ u@@ a@@ ist police , And@@ res S@@ human , how the two reports for them . it has been .
S@@ ir says that today , the pat@@ rolling cre@@ ws and the rapid reaction makers in the streets and also communicate with the people - perhaps they have questions and want to know . how a rapid response should be .
in two days , the police has had to deal with some of the tests and also of the drugs .
&apos;@@ there has also been a few of the large quantities of drug handling , but summar@@ ies will be done when the Weber is over &apos; . that is the case .
around one hundred people have been working in the course of two days in two days .
fortunately , the cases of extreme cases in the police have not been necessary .
by the way , S@@ ir says that , if the sky comes dramatically and horiz@@ on@@ tally , they do not have a lot of work .
one Head of the Ha@@ per@@ la@@ u has once said that rain has never been said .
the P@@ u@@ a@@ ist police have also done the same assistance in the field of the Weber , where things can be found and the same can be demanded of its missing things .
by the way , the police even lose out one of its necessary elements , which good people were able to in@@ vent .
looking at a video which has yet been spoken about by Mr S@@ human .
the statement by the &apos; G@@ un@@ na@@ r Vi@@ es , is speaking to a man that the F@@ esti@@ r was speaking to a man that the F@@ esti@@ r was born in the first years ago . that is , and its owners came under the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast , and that was the case in the P@@ u@@ k@@ n@@ us , and that was the case . the my@@ th that was sold in Estonia .
the G@@ un@@ na@@ r says that they have committed to 25 000 visitors a day , but the tic@@ ks will only be coun@@ ted when a f@@ esti@@ val .
the preparation for today &apos;s silence started as early as September .
&apos;@@ We had information in favour of the city that the previous pos@@ ter begins , there is a ho@@ tel &apos; , the G@@ un@@ na@@ r is speaking about what change in the ne@@ wer . this year we have had to face .
at the moment , there is no K@@ op@@ pa , but it is expected that if the K@@ P@@ P@@ P did not go to the next year .
so , perhaps , we would have had to move away from which , he will explain why this year &apos;s f@@ esti@@ val &apos;s area this year .
the F@@ esti@@ val organisation is over this year .
people are working on a thousand and a half thousand and between a thousand and a half thousand - police officers , the organisation , the security front , and so on .
the most difficult was the most difficult thing , according to Vienna , is the case of the case in Vienna .
it is men who are not an un@@ questionable present present .
why T@@ he C@@ ha@@ in@@ mo@@ city is a difficult for the Weber and how the G@@ un@@ na@@ r is saying that two perfor@@ mers have their own representation . you are already looking at a video of video .
the West is coming to the west of Estonia .
in northern Estonia , there has been much to be heard on several sides in the north of Estonia .
this afternoon , the S@@ oli@@ se Service also gave a sudden warning .
today , in the north of Estonia , there are many quarters of the sudden .
the sudden benefits are rapidly moving from the West .
the &apos; E outbreak &apos; in the south-@@ west of Europe are 18 to 15 , islands and on the coast of 15 , islands and on the coast , but it may result in a stronger nu@@ cle@@ us . &apos;@@ , is standing on the website of the ma@@ gic Service .
however , the far bigger bl@@ ind@@ s , however , in south-@@ east Finland and in the east of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg .
fortunately , the wind in Estonia will be b@@ low@@ ing from the West and the e@@ de@@ b , so at least at the very least , at the very least , at the very least , at least , it is not at the very least at risk .
F@@ in@@ ns were organised by F@@ in@@ ns .
when 11 years ago , the first woman &apos;s tan@@ cer has been held , the organ@@ ise@@ rs were apparently unable to see that the northern neighbour in the north of Estonia . it is by example .
today , however , there is the first Finnish tan@@ ce of Finnish men in Finland .

there is also a f@@ esti@@ val of what is taking place in P@@ be@@ si@@ r , there is loy@@ al f@@ ans .
one of them is , for example , in T@@ wit@@ ter@@ i : &apos; I have the Weber &apos;s ticket to go &apos; .

as far as we are talking about the subject , the road to major plans , perhaps the promises of the promises that they already have to say , a moment ago .
the second party , however , fails to remember the words .
the gu@@ est is in any way to be une@@ as@@ y , it is difficult to focus on action .
you may not be dependent on what is happening now , but never before .
in the difficult situation , too , can be able to act promptly and in a difficult situation .
it is possible that , today , you are going to be in trouble , because there is enough wisdom and determination .
rather , the concern of monetary and business affairs leaves us .
taking the time to rest up the tre@@ e and rela@@ x .
the People &apos;s Party may be ti@@ re@@ less and a lot of ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .
it is possible that we have experienced the situation in which it is a serious debate , during which you must vigorously defend its views .
if the others go beyond the border , you will do you .
better feeling of feeling in a more habi@@ tual environment , making things that are capable and what are positive .
apparently , you are not in a j@@ un@@ k of new knowledge and mix@@ tures .
it is an action that obviously never really is full full of .

however , what is going on is not necessarily the normal thing .
it may be the case that , in spite of one day , you will still have to deal with the glass of fin@@ gers .
or then they were physi@@ cally at home , but it is still behind the work table .
if you want sharp experience , it can offer travel .
it is seiz@@ ing you in the past , you will have to be summar@@ ised in order to maintain and maintain a balance .
also , we are wasting energy in terms of finances .
it is taking this issue only if the situation really requires urgent and decisive intervention .
