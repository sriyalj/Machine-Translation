is the solution , at last , to avoid sen@@ se@@ less ro@@ se-@@ b@@ is ?
for Mr R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , for the phone is often a waste of time .
he in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o in New York , he is in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o in New York , is dependent on customers to b@@ orrow the chic@@ ken , the stick and car@@ to@@ po@@ ts .
however , for a large part of the time , this is automatic messages that try to push through fraud .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is getting to the point that it does not allow anyone who b@@ ars to come to us &apos; , said 24 years old ba@@ r .
aid is on the way , albeit slowly .
over the past year , government stimulus for mobile phones has had new tools to block un@@ soli@@ cited &apos; ro@@ ot@@ ing &apos; .
the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al Com@@ mon@@ ic@@ tion has proposed enabling phone companies to block more j@@ un@@ k speeches and hopes to de@@ ter the petition with large fines .
according to experts , these steps are not a final solution , but they are a good start .
the f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist and K@@ ari@@ c non-@@ call should protect people from un@@ wanted speeches from remote distributors .
however , the fra@@ ud@@ sters are not interested in breaking the law .
the fra@@ ud@@ sters reach the people cheap@@ ly and easily by using &apos; automa@@ ted holders &apos; , which are automatically making am@@ ple speeches at once .
it is estimated that there are tens of millions of ro@@ ckets on a daily basis .
not all of them are , of course , fraudulent .
pharma@@ cies , for example , send automa@@ ted messages on the fulfilment of prescri@@ ptions .
all too often , however , the situation is this : you are in debt to the tax office ; Mic@@ ro@@ y@@ f calls you that you put your computer into your computer ; they are offered free sho@@ ts !
in addition , spa@@ w@@ -@@ el@@ n@@ ers use complex technologies that show the phone as a call to a local or an important figure , such as the tax authority .
implementing suitable measures in the case of &apos; dece@@ ive the numbers &apos; , would make it difficult to make fraud and help to keep the United States &apos; consumers to@@ tal@@ ling millions of dollars , as stated in the Group of Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tors Group of State Public Pro@@ secu@@ tors .
telephone companies and independent applications can be able to screening or block un@@ wanted speeches , compared with the existing problems database and analysing dubious behaviour such as the number that ch@@ oo@@ ses for many people in non-@@ generous lists .
un@@ te@@ na@@ ble service providers also have a to@@ ol@@ box to add warnings such as &apos; g@@ aming &apos; , but they are not available to customers on all phones or with a number of pre-@@ paid card to customers .
they will be commission@@ ed by V@@ er@@ z@@ on and the S@@ prin@@ ce for the premi@@ um .
some of the And@@ ro@@ -@@ te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es , including Google , Pi@@ x@@ el , are mar@@ ching free of charge .
the Mul@@ ti@@ ani producer , J@@ en V@@ ar@@ gas ( 39 ) from the Organisation of Or@@ gan@@ y , who said that his A@@ T &amp; T applications will mark and block certain mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings in his mobile phone , but he has given up his te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y in his mobile phone , but he has abandoned his phone mines .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k very rarely objec@@ ted to the numbers that I do not know &apos; said in V@@ ar@@ gas .
applications such as Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ i and N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o offer domestic phones free , but with restrictions on relief .
in the case of Y@@ ou@@ M@@ T , an operator must authorise &apos; conditional calls &apos; , which will drive a speech forward if the line is not answered or bus@@ y .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available to the parents of the home telephone service , and it is not working with parents , va@@ gu@@ ely te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es .
it is also possible to buy the b@@ os@@ s , some of them are quite ar@@ ro@@ y , which are blocking speeches in their home phones .
V@@ er@@ z@@ on will also carry out a test of sus@@ pi@@ cious speeches on the number of domestic phones .
telephone companies are already in a position to block certain speeches which are fraudulent .
F@@ c@@ c has proposed the rules to form@@ alise such practices and to permit any other suspected speeches to be blocked .
this means that V@@ er@@ z@@ is can block the tax@@ -free figure , which takes the floor for a charge , but it is never going to initiate any one .
the operators would also be able to block speeches in which they know they are not legitimate , such as 9@@ 11 .
these rules need yet to be finalised .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , the public order bu@@ tton , in a non-@@ profit consumer alliance , said that these developments are &apos; encouraging &apos; , but do not protect consumers from all undesirable speeches .
first of all , non-@@ generous permits will not be applied to certain types of gene@@ ro@@ sity , such as the deb@@ tors and political campaigns .
in addition , the ph@@ c rules , according to the Ma@@ h@@ on@@ a@@ y , just to cover fa@@ ke numbers .
all ro@@ ckets are not meant to be f@@ ool .
the consumer union wants telephone companies to make it free to access all consumers at the tools of the blocking of speeches .
in the long term , the Commission supports the efforts of the f@@ c industry that the hel@@ ter really is who he is claiming to be .
perhaps one day we will be able to see a smart phone scre@@ en from the green bo@@ xes if the ro@@ ck is legitimate .
Mr T@@ e@@ ja@@ m says that it could take several years to introduce it , but it would be a powerful tool against the ro@@ b@@ el@@ ers a powerful tool .
F@@ c@@ c is also looking at ways to stop the typical speeches to consumers who change the number .
to register itself in a non-@@ generous list today , but to get a new figure at a later date , the distribu@@ tor may not know it and may be able to quar@@ rel on the new line .
&apos;@@ R@@ ob@@ o@@ th@@ el@@ ers will not go away , the A@@ ar@@ on N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bo@@ o , which is a service for blocking speeches intended to mobile and domestic te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es .
&apos;@@ they are criminal and find a new way to by@@ pass any system .
but our job is to make it as difficult as possible for them &apos; .
there are several logical measures that consumers should be making .
do not answer the phone if you do not know the numbers .
yes , it is unfortunately not practical in the case of companies &apos; calls , such as S@@ port C@@ it@@ y .
stop un@@ intended speeches .
do not speak against and do not press any bu@@ tton .
when you are dealing with them , they can tell you who is reacting , and get you under more speeches .
where possible , the number of the speech will be blocked after the speech .
use the speeches blocking applications .
if you have concerns about privacy , check the rules on the application to see whether it shares your speech or contact data with the distributors .
do not give lo@@ sers personal data , such as the number of a bank account or social security .

the technical possibilities for this are available both in infrastructure and in terms of rolling stock &apos; , the G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in said .
another point has also been made by G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in that there are Russian trains that can switch from rob@@ ber@@ y and continue to move on the European track .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in believes that this trend is in a position , because at the moment the people of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg and the entire inhabitants of Russia must travel to Germany through Moscow and B@@ rest .

however , when four working and three days of rest are concerned , however , that is a forced solution to that effect .

how do we finance the vehicles of a company ?
in a changing consumer society , financial opportunities for the vehicles of the enlarged companies - next to a plant , there is an increasing number of companies , but also full services , or a mandatory , long-term author .
the purchase and rent of vehicle are two clearly different financial operations , which cover different commitments and expectations , but which are often confusing .
the international author &apos;s company , a@@ vis Estonia , the sale and marketing leader of Estonia , Mr T@@ rin@@ di , has estimated that companies are increasingly moving towards a full-@@ level services and also increasing the possibility of long-term le@@ asing out .
the T@@ o@@ er pointed out the main issues to which , when looking for answers , it is possible to choose a suitable way of using a vehicle .
how long can we take advantage of the vehicle ?
the greatest difference in le@@ asing and li@@ ating the car is the time to use .
it is worth trying to favour a longer period of time when a business has plans to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period &apos; , by adding that it would be worthwhile to decide if they want to have a vehicle , for the benefit of a single service , if you want to have a vehicle , for the benefit of a ful@@ ly-@@ fledged journey , if a vehicle is to be used as a good , if you want to use the vehicle , if you want a car , to use a car , but leaving it up to a car , but leaving up a service , as well as the &apos; withdrawal &apos; of the vehicle but , if you want to , to use the vehicle for the longer term , when a business is to be used , if they want ownership .
&apos;@@ R@@ official car has a far shorter application period from the credit period , but many of the major car companies also provide a long-term author , where car ren@@ king is taking place without complex contracts and free recovery &apos; , the T@@ ö@@ l@@ d &apos;s various options for le@@ asing the car .
who is the vehicle &apos;s ow@@ ner ?
at the end of the customs agreement , the ow@@ ner of a le@@ t@@ mil@@ d car ow@@ ner .
in the case of the &apos; closed service drive &apos; , it is possible to carry on with the same or better conditions , by getting the same new vehicle that meets the needs of the company &apos; , by emphasising that , because consumer society is increasingly relo@@ cated to the core consumption of services , the vehicle is increasingly moving towards an additional commitment to the company .
in addition , in the case of a full services , there is an opportunity for a desire and a car to be bought on the basis of agreed conditions .
however , this period of application is not , and will be paid only for a period of use .
the purchase of a car generally takes place in the representation of car companies and le@@ asing the car from the temporary agency plant .
while car firms are , first and foremost , working on vehicle sales , but also , in some cases , the possibility of the mer@@ cy and , in some cases , the author .
however , R@@ or@@ ine companies have the sole aim of le@@ tting them out .
in the war that the reasons for the use of the ren@@ tal service are different - many companies are le@@ asing their companies , as well as being able to use the service as custom@@ er or holiday or when their own car is in an improvement .
in the case of public vehicles , more and more is being transferred to the full service service , which offers consumers the transparency of costs , time savings in the purchase , use and recovery of vehicles , and greater convenience &apos; , was introduced by the head of the sale and marketing man@@ ager of the growing mer@@ chan@@ ts .
every year , an ever-increasing number of companies are using full services , in the case of their fleets , thus optimis@@ ing its expenditure and focusing on their core business .
what is the coverage of servi@@ ce@@ -based insurance ?
when a li@@ tre of a car has a compulsory c@@ at and motor insurance , the ren@@ tal car is mostly covered by basic insurance and , furthermore , it has to be decided whether to take on , for example , the case of emergency insurance , to@@ tal@@ ling insurance or full insurance , while compared to a medical service , the custom@@ er receives more in terms of monthly taxes , as , in addition to the vehicles and the insurance , they also cover the month payment . these are due care , 24 / day assistance , ty@@ re exchanges and other agreed services &apos; , explained T@@ ö@@ l@@ d .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the com@@ posi@@ tion can be taken into any new vehicle , in the case of the full services , a vehicle that is geared to the wishes and needs of a vehicle that is tailored to the company &apos;s wishes and needs , he is compared , by stressing that the full services agreement will certainly help to opti@@ mise costs of a company &apos;s car fleet .
however , the choice of train vehicles depends , however , on the service &apos;s le@@ asing vehicles - the different le@@ vers are offering a vehicle in their vehicle fleet , both small and econom@@ ical vehicle for the use of urban traffic , and the T@@ o@@ w , described T@@ o@@ w .
in a heavy ren@@ tal period , it may , of course , happen that the car that wants to be paid out is already being paid out , but it will help to book the desired vehicle early .
between le@@ is@@ ure or ren@@ ting , first of all , it should be clear first of all to make our objectives - as long as the desire for the vehicle is to be used for a long time , and which are long-term plans for car .
it is certainly worth looking carefully at the different conditions and obligations of services .
how a man built his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter with a dossier of around 51 million dollars .
one in the T@@ ex@@ as is discovered that there is not a single factor in which his person with his disability could be able to play .
he therefore decided to build one itself .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N has just come out of the basin on his family holiday when his 12-@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Morgan went to the other children who are playing in water .
he tried to get a gri@@ p with them , but they quickly broke out .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N believes that they are going to happen because they do not know how to deal with people with disabilities - the Morgan has a five-year approach , as well as the form of certain au@@ tis@@ m .
that incident was wor@@ shi@@ pped by this incident .
&apos;@@ Morgan is a baby gir@@ l of the baby .
his meeting will always lead to a laugh@@ ing stock and he certainly wants to ro@@ b .
however , there have been many times where we have not been able to bring him into different places &apos; , he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and his wife Mag@@ gi@@ e asked the other parents to where they could get their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters - go where he feels comfortable and others feel comfortable with her .
&apos;@@ we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as &apos; , the H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N is telling .
he therefore decided to build it ourselves in 2007 .
the former property develop@@ ers sold their own homes in 2005 , in order to build the British H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N F@@ am@@ e@@ y F@@ ou@@ n@@ vel@@ as - a no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit association that will help people with disabilities .
it then started &apos; the creation of the first highly accessible thematic par@@ k in the world .
&apos;@@ We wanted to create a thematic par@@ k where everyone can do everything where they can play with both the specific needs and those without special needs &apos; , is spoken by H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he has conven@@ ed doctors , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ als , parents and other people without disabilities , so that it can be consulted on the establishment .
they were set out in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ ex@@ as , a 10@@ 0-@@ hec@@ tar@@ ted career in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ ex@@ as .
the Par@@ k called M@@ body W@@ on@@ der@@ land , paid 34 million dollars ( GBP 26 million ) and was opened in 2010 .
the tra@@ cks include a total , accessible vacuum , a pla@@ y@@ ground and wh@@ ir@@ on@@ g .
visitors are often saying to Har@@ t@@ mann that they had only the first time to experience such at@@ ro@@ rs .
there is also a ca@@ rou@@ sel that speci@@ fies wh@@ eel@@ chairs , which travel to the animals , which go down and below the animals .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N recognises , however , that Morgan was fe@@ ar@@ ful in terms of war at the beginning .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we opened , he did not dare to go to that .
he did not understand why it is going around , and why animals are coming up and under &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
it took three years before Morgan was willing to go to the ca@@ rou@@ sel .
at the beginning , he simply stood close to it , then he would be making animal , but we did not launch war .
it was a slow process , but now he is lo@@ ving it .
getting overcome to something that was intimi@@ dated by him was a lot for him .
the small things that have been achieved in playing will make a big difference &apos; .
since its opening , there are more than a million people from 67 countries in W@@ on@@ der@@ land has been visited by Morgan .
one third of staff are disabled and entry are free of charge for anyone with a state of illness .
&apos;@@ I have understood that the Morgan is one of the happy ones , because he has a lot of things for him .
I did not want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
&apos;@@ S@@ hu@@ t every year , knowing that we are at least a million dollar ( 750 000 p@@ ounds ) , and we have to make it back with the help of the cor@@ ps with the help of the cor@@ ps and our partners &apos; .
this year , the thematic par@@ k Morgan , has been extended to the opening of a fully accessible aqu@@ atic par@@ k , which is fully accessible .
&apos;@@ in July , fewer people visited a par@@ k , as wh@@ eel@@ chairs went too far .
therefore , we have chosen to set up a aqu@@ atic par@@ k , is talking about H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
in some parts of the island , gender water has been used which will help those who come to meat problems .
water@@ k kil@@ lers are being made available , which are working with explo@@ sive air and not bat@@ teri@@ es .
it is also possible to drive on the river as well .
the V@@ ar@@ par@@ k paid together a total of 17 million dollars ( GBP 13 million ) .
&apos;@@ yesterday , a man came to me and just kept me up &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N was coming out to me &apos; .
&apos;@@ he referred to his son , who has serious specific needs , and he came to k@@ ni@@ fe .
he said that he had not had his son previously had the water to play in the past &apos; .
according to Mr Harbour , there are not three par@@ ks with all four visitors with disabilities , and this is the effect that he was hoping for .
&apos;@@ This helps people understand that , while we are different in certain ways , we are in fact exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;@@ I saw one of the gir@@ l &apos;s gir@@ l went to another , without special need for girls , and they began to play together .
it was a really big &apos; .
Mr Har@@ t@@ man@@ i does not intend to open up more par@@ ks , even though he has received hundreds of letters from the pos@@ ta@@ u and on the way hundreds of letters from people who would like to have a par@@ k in his own neighbourhood .
instead , he is focusing on giving young people with special needs in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os on the provision of educational facilities for young people with special needs .
&apos;@@ I know that there are many different organisations that try elsewhere to build a state of the W@@ on@@ der@@ land , and we will continue to work with them &apos; .
it will continue to play a part in the subject party - Morgan is now being a kind of audi@@ ence .
&apos;@@ when he comes here , he is like a ro@@ ker !
many people want to speak with him and with him a picture , he is doing so well &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
Morgan , which is now 2@@ 3-@@ year-old , can do things better .
&apos;@@ he is speaking more and most of his physical problems have been solved by a large number of operations .
we are so proud that it has reached this point &apos; .
if the Morgan par@@ k is visiting him , I like to play the w@@ o@@ es and on the s@@ k@@ al@@ ts , without seeing how much it has helped others .
&apos;@@ Morgan knows that the par@@ k has become his name according to him , but I do not think he understands what it actually represents and how it actually represents lives &apos; , is spoken by H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou do not understand that the way in which he has survi@@ ved in his life has made her a real source of inspiration .
the call to find drivers for a gir@@ l in W@@ it@@ ton on two of the gir@@ l in W@@ it@@ ton
the police are trying to find two motor@@ ists in connection with a study of the rape of a four@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l .
on 26 July , in the region of B@@ ir@@ ming@@ ha@@ m , on 26 July in the W@@ it@@ ton region on 26 July : 00 ( B@@ S@@ T ) .
before that attack he was ra@@ ped at the W@@ it@@ ton plant .
as regards the first case , an accus@@ ation has been made to a single man .
the British transport police would like to speak as part of the investigation as part of the two car drivers .
according to the police , the first of the car is a ga@@ vel pa@@ int on the he@@ els of the car .
in the words of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , T@@ ony F@@ it@@ z@@ l@@ ric@@ k , said : &apos; we have grounds for belie@@ ving that the driver of the vehicle was a victim to the plant before another person ch@@ ur@@ ned and then ra@@ ped in the car .
we want to know what was said during this conver@@ sation , and the driver may know about important details which would help us in the investigation &apos; .
the second driver of a vehicle , which was described according to the Red C@@ ross , according to the police , the victim probably said at home after he had been ra@@ ped for a second time .
it was the case that G@@ en@@ e was c@@ lu@@ t@@ ched at the end of the year .
a ba@@ il-@@ out c@@ run@@ ch who was supported for his ow@@ ner , was called the growth of the year .
the G@@ en@@ i@@ e was recognised as it has con@@ signed its own ow@@ ner , L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n ( 11 ) , six chemical comp@@ ounds .
E@@ vi@@ e was diagno@@ sed in March 201@@ 6 and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e movement in March 201@@ 6 and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e company in March 201@@ 6 and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e company in a long hospital .
this was recognised by the bo@@ y ch@@ arity organisation , Ca@@ ts Pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ k , at the London ceremony .
the pil@@ letter : according to the E@@ vi@@ e , it was supported by her when he lost their long li@@ g@@ és as a result of ch@@ emo@@ es lost their long li@@ g@@ és as a result of his ch@@ emo@@ tion .
&apos;@@ in my view , he is best .
he deserves that .
he has always existed to me &apos; , said E@@ vi@@ e .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l came up to my stone and turn to my feet .
he bu@@ ried a stone , and then the han@@ g , then to the man , that they had to p@@ in in my eyes .
when I was too sick so that friends can come to visit or to get out , and I had to sit at home , he came to me , and that turned me much more jo@@ y , offering a great hu@@ mb@@ ling &apos; .
according to the E@@ vi@@ e , he has a special link with his pe@@ ts , which was an enormous support for him if he lost his ha@@ ir as a result of exhaus@@ ting treatment .
&apos;@@ that led me very much , because I had long bro@@ wn bro@@ thers .
however , as there was a f@@ lam@@ es , the G@@ en@@ i@@ e was equally harsh and that I lost my ha@@ ir and G@@ en@@ i@@ e himself , brought a bit of the shock of the same shock &apos; .
E@@ vi@@ e &apos;s father , Mr H@@ end@@ er@@ son , said that there has been &apos; excellent attention to the slogan &apos; and described how E@@ vi@@ e &apos; was a ha@@ ven for his lo@@ ved fav@@ ou@@ rite , into his lo@@ ved pe@@ ts .
&apos;@@ E@@ vi@@ e was over 300 days in the hospital , so so we have spent a lot of time there , and it offered him something that we can expect if he were to get home to a few valuable days &apos; .

the business group ch@@ oo@@ ses the government to agree on the transition conditions in Bre@@ x@@ di .
one of the largest business lobby groups in Britain is urging the government to close tan@@ kers at the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery of tan@@ ks .
the In@@ te@@ re@@ th@@ in majority of Di@@ res ( I@@ D ) turned to the government to propose a &apos; transitional agreement &apos; in order to make progress with the Bre@@ x .
it is asking for the government to establish the gap between the &apos; Bu@@ x@@ di gap &apos; , and the establishment of new trade agreements .
the group warned that without such a contract , a business would be faced with a &apos; short-term cha@@ otic ro@@ ck fluctu@@ ation &apos; .
they criticised the government in connection with the &apos; transition &apos; in all speculative disputes for &apos; com@@ pul@@ sion &apos; .
in recent weeks , members of the government have presented conflicting views on how long the transition period continues and what it brings with it .
the I@@ D report , &apos; A ri@@ val of the gap &apos; - the possibilities for the transition &apos; is written : &apos; instead of far to def@@ use the problem , the government must res@@ tar@@ t a strategic debate on this matter .
this could minimise the ever-increasing confusion and uncertainty in this area &apos; .
however , Mr Ly@@ on , the econom@@ ist and the E@@ con@@ om@@ ship of the Bre@@ x , has this week described the concerns about the &apos; po@@ pp@@ y &apos; , which is re@@ minis@@ cent of the &apos; po@@ pp@@ y &apos; , which rese@@ m@@ bles the case of &apos; pan@@ ac@@ ea &apos; , which rese@@ m@@ bles the case of Y@@ 2@@ K &apos;s M@@ DG failure .
the War@@ k@@ an@@ c@@ ill@@ ler warned the June : &apos; there is a large number of commercial investment , which will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely result of these discussions is &apos; .
Al@@ lie Ren@@ is@@ on , the leader of the I@@ D@@ R , the leader of the trade policy , said : &apos; K@@ ey@@ on has the right to worry about the d@@ ash of commercial investments .
this is one of the most commonly reviewed changes to be dealt with in relation to Bre@@ x@@ es , which must be dealt with in relation to Bre@@ x@@ es .
the latter applies particularly to the members of the I@@ o@@ D in Northern Ireland who are now considering the collective establishment or relocation &apos; .
the I@@ D proposes several options , including the following extension of the Article 50 agreement from March 201@@ 9 from March 201@@ 9 .
accession to the European Economic Area
to be able to remain in the government of the EU of the rest of the EU legislation .
the creation of a transitional customs agreement , similar to the EU customs union .
he said : &apos; the I@@ D has proposed these options with regard to the transition , in the hope that it will spar@@ k the proper debate on how to put it at the end of Bre@@ x .

professional sport stands at a cross@@ roads in Australia : some areas have been emig@@ rated by corpor@@ means so far that it is too business to classi@@ fy sport ;
others are returning to the world of ama@@ te@@ ur , which is too in the sporting environment to consider it as a business .
this confusion is being caused by the painful delays of the C@@ ric@@ k@@ d A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ a ( a ) tor@@ tu@@ ous delays in the achievement of a wage settlement agreement with players , with the im@@ possibility of dis@@ mis@@ sal of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ a football f@@ ed@@ her , the up@@ rising of the stakeholders , ru@@ g@@ ly difficulties of a functioning independent committee on a functioning , and Australia &apos;s in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent efforts to be among the people a flag of social justice among the people . the be@@ are@@ r .
the Investment Pan@@ el and A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an President of the Committee on S@@ port , John W@@ y@@ li@@ e , has been trying to lead the Olympic report actively on the same path as professional species by placing busines@@ spe@@ ople who do not have eli@@ tist experience in the field of sport .
in the case of Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to@@ t , who has a reputation for the ta@@ cit use of the ta@@ ctic use of trade unions , was seen as a col@@ lis@@ ion with the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an players &apos; union ( AC@@ A ) .
Mr David Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r is a former Man@@ aging President of Ri@@ o tin@@ to A@@ us@@ tr@@ inter , and he is the former Executive Director of Ri@@ o tin@@ to , and he is be@@ a@@ ten by the head of Ri@@ o tin@@ to and ad@@ minister .
it would be mistaken , however , would be to believe that an elite business@@ man , whose approach is mer@@ ci@@ less when it comes to dealing with cri@@ cket players will not enjoy it as sport .
the Pe@@ e@@ per was , for example , a regular visit to the homes of S@@ storm , until he went to the other state .
in spite of this , tough negotiations between and AC@@ A , and extremely high wages have given the impression that the fav@@ ou@@ rite reference of Australia in Australia is now a business more than the gu@@ ise of sport .
on the contrary , however , the failure of the former CE@@ O of Mr Cameron , Mr Cam@@ er@@ on C@@ ly@@ ne , the inability of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ by team has been dying too much back to its roots .
the people of the Re@@ ag@@ on Union now prefer to lead to the sta@@ di@@ um in order to look at the game between the ama@@ te@@ ur teams , while on the loo@@ ting , at the same time as being be@@ a@@ ten and gu@@ es@@ sing the h@@ ung@@ ry .
R@@ ag@@ bi@@ li@@ it is bo@@ the@@ red that they have the most qualified and varied board in Australia in Australia , but it is too much a failure to meet the demands of international partners , that it is still too much of sport in order to be business .
both ra@@ g@@ bi@@ or and football have problems with management , as the stakeholders are asking for more power .
both too Cha@@ irs , John G@@ ran@@ t AR@@ L@@ C and Ste@@ ven L@@ ow@@ y Ma@@ in , have shown that their commercial skills have not been sufficient to achieve corporate stability .
G@@ ran@@ t , the former K@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o , led a successful IT company , but 20 years had the game completely out of the game .
it was the value of the newly formed AR@@ L@@ C , which was formed by the newly formed AR@@ L@@ C .
it was the other stakeholders who did not trust each other , decided that someone who has participated in the Commission &apos;s work in any way in the ra@@ g@@ rich in the last three years , except as passive f@@ ans .
however , pensions went too far to the business side and too f@@ ans have been looking for the sa@@ vi@@ der from that time - someone who would have a named past in sport .
Mr L@@ ow@@ y , head of the R@@ ene@@ w@@ ol@@ he , who is the chief chair of my father , from my father , on the one hand from a man &apos;s wealth .
the club@@ s would like to be better represented in the electoral Congress in the selection Congress .

iron@@ ically , sport and business ethics send amb@@ assa@@ dors to the F@@ IF@@ A to stop the civil war in sport .
the A@@ G has its own contacts with Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to@@ i , the former Govern@@ or of Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to@@ s , the former then Commissioner , Mr L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , former Commissioner of L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , former Commissioner of L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , the former Commissioner of L@@ y@@ n@@ ch .
it is too proud to take the role of a national leader in the promotion of gender equality , indigenous and refugee activities and the promotion of gay rights .
some cy@@ n@@ ics would in@@ sin@@ u@@ ate that this is done in the ca@@ ps of government aid funds .
by Mr Go@@ y@@ der , Mr Go@@ y@@ der , who said : &apos; A@@ F@@ L is more than a business , given how it assis@@ ts all those communities &apos; .
Mr Go@@ y@@ der is the out@@ going executive President and the first chair@@ person of the A@@ FL@@ P , who has not played the game at the elite level .

the definition of the appointment of members of the governing board members of professional sports , often priorit@@ ising independence in the face of competence .
in the up@@ take of the recruitment of business people , they have forgotten about something that could be called aff@@ ec@@ tion and a bit@@ ter sport .
what is more , many corporate heav@@ y@@ we@@ ights are not used to intensive and sometimes also personal monitoring of the media .
something that works in the world of corpor@@ at@@ ism may not pass on the sporting field .
the Court of Jordan en@@ rol@@ led the life sentence of three United States military killing of the three United States of America .
the Chi@@ ef A@@ ppe@@ al Court of Jordan , the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian sol@@ di@@ er was sentenced to a life sentence of three US military schools last year .
the Supreme Court last month set the flight base of the United Nations flight base for the killing of the Americans on a life prison sentence for the slaughter of the Americans , along with hard work .
the Al@@ -@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ m was opened by the Americans to the car@@ a@@ ts of the Americans , claiming that he was afraid of an attack on the base .

&apos;@@ K@@ e@@ v@@ in plays a lot of f@@ il@@ ls and we needed a lot of &apos; , Mr F@@ og@@ el@@ man said .
at the end of the last season , K@@ e@@ v@@ in was given an important role from the coun@@ ty , R@@ on Ho@@ war@@ d , who had s@@ ingu@@ l@@ arly failed .
during this season , we can see how the project is participating in the project and , at the same time , re@@ vita@@ lis@@ ing relations with its own ex@@ ile , who will be ex@@ hibi@@ ted by the x@@ and@@ ra of B@@ and@@ ra .

J@@ am@@ es Har@@ li@@ at is about USD 300 000 a year in order to keep her body in a gam@@ ble .
every N@@ V@@ L player is dependent on its own body in order to earn a living .
therefore , many other people also invest in plenty of money in poor care and recovery in order to stay in excellence .
Je@@ re@@ my F@@ o@@ w@@ ler portal ES@@ P@@ N@@ .@@ co@@ m more closely rese@@ ar@@ ched how far some ve@@ ter@@ ans are ready to go to pro@@ long their careers .
however , none of this is as extreme as the 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , the 14@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , the nor@@ th-@@ speaking period of the preparation of the Pittsburgh S@@ tras@@ h@@ line .
according to the Fo@@ rest , K@@ ow@@ ten sp@@ ends 300 000 dollars a year to a need@@ le , dis@@ gu@@ ise , bo@@ ro@@ y@@ men and bul@@ bs .
most of the costs are linked to the country &apos;s travel , in order to meet with specialists .
&apos;@@ I do not need to keep a record of such things &apos; , Mr K@@ ris@@ is said .
&apos;@@ if you compare the sums that have been earned with me , the payments are worth it , given how I feel &apos; .
M@@ ike Mitchell , the bri@@ lli@@ ant of Har@@ ris@@ on and the team com@@ patri@@ ot in S@@ impli@@ y , assessed the amount of 200 000 per year of care for her body .
a period of 3@@ 0-@@ year-old Mitchell has con@@ signed up to the body ( &apos; bo@@ y temper@@ et &apos; ) which F@@ o@@ w@@ ler described as &apos; 55 kil@@ o me@@ tal used as a dis@@ gu@@ ise of the use of 55 kil@@ o me@@ tal as a dis@@ gu@@ ise &apos; .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are being s@@ pur@@ red on it &apos; , Mr Mitchell said it .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you have a few b@@ lin@@ ke@@ red place and they are starting to move around the matter , it is at times the wrong one .
however , if you stand up , the tension has disappeared immediately .
it is just running out of the tension &apos; .
they are prepared to make additional efforts , but the former N@@ O players , Bar@@ ry Co@@ fi@@ els and R@@ y@@ an Har@@ ris spend an average of USD 50 000 per year .
Co@@ fi@@ el@@ le@@ d , who played the next 10 season in New York Gi@@ an@@ tine and Washington &apos;s P@@ an@@ k , have regret@@ ted that he did not spend any more .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I could go back , I would invest even more &apos; , Co@@ fi@@ el@@ les F@@ ow@@ ler said to F@@ ow@@ ler .
&apos;@@ I would probably spend at least two times more .
I was the first eight years in my career with a very good health .
perhaps more than more procedures would have been to put an end to the end &apos; .
R@@ yan Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a &apos; 2@@ 4-@@ year-old defence line &apos; , expressed the readiness to take on the foot@@ wear of S@@ es@@ le@@ r@@ si in the foot@@ steps of the S@@ tol@@ le@@ r@@ si .
&apos;@@ when you have 100 000 dollars and you have an additional three million when he or she is playing , this decision is quite simple &apos; , Mr Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er said .
as far as careers are concerned , investing in the recovery of players is much smar@@ ter than spending money on cars and on buildings .
the Central N@@ O player will carry on , if he can play longer than 30 years , all the more the success of Har@@ ris@@ on should convince his colleagues about his expenditure on the other .
but maybe they can find some local professionals .
how the prin@@ ter Di@@ er used his me@@ i as a weapon .
when I think of Mrs Di@@ an , the first thing we need to do is to the bridge .
under the young age of a gir@@ l , a young gir@@ l .
later on , the black wave of his Martin B@@ ash@@ ir &apos; of the &apos; Pan@@ or@@ am@@ a &apos; , the effect of which had been devastating if he turned through the c@@ oo@@ t b@@ el@@ t , bringing the famous dead phrase : &apos; we were three in this marriage , so it was a little bit too popular &apos; .
the big and no@@ tori@@ ous eyes , surroun@@ ded by his gri@@ e@@ van@@ ces , d@@ il@@ u@@ ted in the face of a black face , forced him to give the impression that she was w@@ ounded .
this is precisely the effect he has been trying to achieve .
she was never accompanied by prin@@ ted by P@@ rin@@ ce Di@@ ana at the time , in particular , was not the case at least in terms of modern standards .
it was not just that he did not need it - he was , of course , beautiful - but he saw the th@@ or@@ ny commitment to it , something that is more about a job rather than a single one .
in the public he was able to wear a th@@ ick me@@ k in the public .
this is the case that he arrived at the offices of the publis@@ hers of the V@@ o@@ gu@@ ys &apos; i by we@@ aring a pa@@ g , almost or@@ an@@ ge .
he a@@ po@@ log@@ ises me by saying that his sk@@ in needs to be s@@ ke@@ wed as a sun , because , if he were to go out &apos; , then the tab@@ oo@@ s would photo@@ g@@ rap@@ hed him and then make any allegations that he sees &apos; du@@ red &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; , &apos; ti@@ red &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; .
it is precisely for this reason that Mrs Di@@ ana was speaking three times a week , using a machine at our home .
today , of course , this would be re@@ pro@@ ach for health reasons , of course , but for Di@@ ana , it was a useful aim - it enabled it to show the world the face of his sun , even though his in@@ ner was filled by the black cl@@ ou@@ ds and a lot .
the greatest mistake of the Ro@@ y@@ al family was to think that , if they were to approve him for the hus@@ band of Char@@ les , they will be able to receive one small beautiful jo@@ y , who would only have the su@@ per of sugar .
the reality , however , was the opposite .
he may not have been the best in school for school , but when it was about the creation of the baby , it was a completely modern student .
it was the importance of a so@@ ya and the me@@ ta@@ l that it was possible to use them in order to take a wind or a sense .
otherwise they did not offer him the slightest interest .
his friend R@@ os@@ a R@@ os@@ a R@@ os@@ a R@@ os@@ a - Di@@ ana was his youn@@ gest child &apos;s din@@ ner - remember that we were not something they used to talk about .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k to remember is &apos; , he said &apos; how much relief he felt at those times when we went to rest together and did not see ourselves the me@@ ta@@ le &apos; .
today , we tend to think about a man as something that improves on the woman &apos;s appearance , but it is clear that he used it as a tool of powerful P@@ R .
these moments , when he felt the most free of all , was the most in his own , are the moments when it was also the most natural , with a very few me@@ tre .
in 199@@ 3 , together with two young son bo@@ y T@@ hor@@ pe , the T@@ hor@@ pe par@@ g T@@ hor@@ pe , the B@@ ar Le@@ a@@ b , he had gone through and s@@ ne@@ wed he@@ igh@@ ten , a b@@ read@@ th and s@@ mi@@ red from a he@@ ight of eyes like any other mother who has spent days with children .
four months after he was announced and the departure of Mr Char@@ les , he finally saw a s@@ pan@@ ner of what he and the &apos; usual &apos; was announced .
or in recent years out of the tra@@ in@@ e@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , ha@@ vo@@ c in the form of cy@@ c@@ ab@@ ling , face a face from a tre@@ e , health and the life@@ blood in all his bo@@ y .
to put an end to his life , when he started to assert his independence and his confidence gre@@ w , we saw more and more of such Di@@ an@@ a .
he was united with the H@@ al@@ o T@@ r@@ ust and wal@@ ked through Ang@@ ol@@ a in January 1997 .
at the time 3@@ 5-@@ year , the e@@ ter@@ nal soft and natural , almost all of the me@@ als , I think he would probably see as much as ever before , reminding it of a sh@@ re@@ w@@ ent and hopeful young gir@@ l who s@@ mi@@ red to the bottom of 15 years .
Mrs Di@@ ana was just reaching its best years .
at the earliest times , a young Di@@ ana S@@ pen@@ c@@ er was the pre-@@ emin@@ ent nature of the R@@ a@@ ff@@ er .
however , it did not go a long time until &apos; prin@@ ted f@@ las@@ si@@ fication &apos; - a process which , in particular , di@@ ri@@ lised mainly by a press and a call to make Di@@ an@@ ese a young woman who is worthy of his new status .
in part , it involved the work of the C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ ward , a me@@ tre of me@@ ter@@ an , who was often used by L@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ by .
Ho@@ ws met , for the first time , S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ oni K@@ sin@@ ton &apos;s city in K@@ sin@@ ton , in order to put on record the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine for V@@ o@@ gu@@ e .
at that moment , at the end of the 1980s , Di@@ ana was only at the end of the 1980s .
her most be@@ a@@ ten products came from Ms Bo@@ dy S@@ h@@ an , for example , in the sight of El@@ der@@ f@@ lor@@ a .
Ho@@ w@@ ard used Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ ter &apos;s j@@ ar@@ di@@ us , S@@ he@@ er , H@@ one@@ y Tou@@ ch and the Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ ter &apos;s min@@ k at the then time .
to the S@@ p@@ al@@ al@@ ties , he was we@@ aring E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th of R@@ ic@@ e and Tim@@ ber@@ land and the White H@@ ind@@ o@@ tar@@ s to the next .
the E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th T@@ ar@@ den was enri@@ ched by Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th of E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th of E@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den .
and we know all this because Mr Ho@@ ward created a face scheme for him .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an e@@ u is such an admi@@ rable colour that I wanted to stress the ast@@ ounding &apos; , he wrote later on .
however , the end result is not particularly attractive to this young gir@@ l - it looks like 18 years old , who is becoming 50 .
it is too op@@ pres@@ sive and too much e@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ te that has been borne in the eyes .
the most striking thing here , however , is the inf@@ am@@ ous a@@ ja@@ sis of the Tur@@ k@@ man on this ton@@ ti@@ er of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y prin@@ ted in your blue ton@@ es .
to the fan@@ tas@@ y of fan@@ tas@@ y .
it is no wonder why Mrs J@@ am@@ a is looking at our side with a little in@@ conc@@ lusive one .
one of the source of par@@ ac@@ ity was the fact that he never knew where the public family would turn out and starts with privacy .
that was the start of this process .
a person who was probably the most affected by her speech was M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l , who is still playing an important role in the modern world of the world today .
the Me@@ ster who is now , among others , C@@ i@@ da@@ l , is still one of the em@@ pi@@ res in the world of the world .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana had an incredibly nice sk@@ in and long inf@@ le@@ xi@@ es &apos; , he rese@@ m@@ bles him .
&apos;@@ he was just a mira@@ cle .
the men were hea@@ ven for him .
he was sex@@ y without trying to do so &apos; .
for the first time in 199@@ 1 , the M@@ ary Court of Di@@ ana in 199@@ 1 , when V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , at that time , Mrs Harms asked him to do her Di@@ ana before at the December photo@@ g@@ raph with one of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine of the single ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine of the single ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , Pat@@ ric@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ ch .
S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ ho , the team was also attended by S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h .
it took place when Mrs Di@@ ana and Mr Char@@ les were the most important and public support started in the name of public support .
&apos;@@ they did not tell us who it was , although we knew that it was someone who was a famous one &apos; , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ wal@@ n said .
&apos; when we arrived , Di@@ ana was just too beautiful there , was so@@ ya and friendly and extremely ex@@ cited , that he could be at the front of the V@@ o@@ gu@@ e .
it was a ca@@ an@@ e@@ m - Di@@ e@@ red in a car@@ g , the na@@ il about the hand , his blue eyes to the special , a c@@ and@@ l@@ ous eyes to the special , a c@@ and@@ l@@ man of the French man , the short cut - was revolu@@ tionary .
that is the speed of positive , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and e@@ leg@@ ant .
above all , it was modern , by conve@@ ying the presence of the early n@@ ine@@ ties cl@@ im@@ ated by early n@@ ine@@ ties , and creating strong con@@ tras@@ ts between Mrs Di@@ ana and the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily , who was in front of the hor@@ ro@@ bi@@ l , as the Qu@@ e@@ en mentioned it afterwards .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana was very ten@@ se with her me@@ a .
he simply wanted to see fresh and different &apos; , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ wal@@ he said .
over time , she taught Di@@ ana himself - a pe@@ er - pe@@ er - T@@ w@@ ning cre@@ w , a c@@ lu@@ k c@@ on for raising our eyes , a b@@ et of b@@ et - and stressed healthy sk@@ in rou@@ tine , encouraging him to look after his and follow the man@@ tra &apos; in@@ ner in the &apos; internal day &apos; .
Di@@ et &apos; has done everything in moder@@ n@@ ity &apos; , Mr Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l says .
he paid enough and reduced the consumption of alcohol , which is very important to the detriment of the poor .
the prin@@ ter of Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in was preferred by Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in , a C@@ lar@@ ine , C@@ lar@@ in@@ si , C@@ lar@@ ine , and Clin@@ tin@@ ique , Wil@@ d Ro@@ se .
however , the biggest service that M@@ ary Di@@ ana was doing was his bul@@ lying from the blue bridge .
&apos;@@ L@@ et simply did so much old &apos; , he said .
instead , it used the combination of soft li@@ g@@ ni@@ tes and neutral tone to a to@@ ol@@ box with a to@@ i@@ ler on a pen@@ sion@@ ary , which had been integrated among themselves , so that everyone was fairly soft .
he often used the tone of the then cre@@ do and a little Sol@@ ar service to highlight the healthy s@@ word .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an was custom@@ ary to me to call me and invite me to discuss products , which I was very pleased to do &apos; , said to me by Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ da@@ l .
&apos;@@ I think that was a rela@@ xation for him ; the opportunity to take a few moments &apos; .
his fav@@ ou@@ rite br@@ and was a luxury mark in C@@ lar@@ ine .
Di@@ ana allegedly used the agenda and night of day and night for their sensitive sk@@ in , and to the drug plants for the Al@@ p@@ ine drug plants .
he also went to the cosme@@ tics of the F@@ il@@ der@@ man Central London in Central London on a regular basis .
Di@@ ana had a famous sk@@ in , but at times he had a Roma , a moderate pro@@ pul@@ sion , which is often due to stress .
in order to mitigate this , he used natural f@@ lam@@ es , including the b@@ light me@@ tre oil .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an@@ al had a mag@@ nific@@ ent luxury structure &apos; , Mr Gre@@ en@@ wal@@ he said .
the only part of his appearance , on which he was very confident , was his jo@@ ke .
give him a reminder : &apos; at a time when the newspapers wrote that he had been going to N@@ in@@ ga , turned to me and said in her laugh@@ ing : &apos; honestly , if I had allowed his no@@ vel@@ o@@ pe@@ la@@ ted , &apos; W@@ hen you are going to have chosen his no@@ se , so that I would then have chosen it ? &apos;
when the advice of Mrs G@@ re@@ en@@ wal@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ t &apos;s advice , Di@@ as felt to be more and more self-@@ confident in terms of its new appearance .
one of his most familiar with the public - in 1994 in the S@@ p@@ ing@@ -@@ in G@@ ec@@ p@@ here in London in London , where he du@@ mped the famous &apos; ab@@ hor@@ rent &apos; , ex@@ tri@@ cate , un@@ covered by a f@@ ig@@ u@@ red ex@@ hibi@@ tion of a f@@ ig@@ u@@ red ex@@ hibi@@ tion of the scale of his life - shows that a further sign@@ alling of his life has come out .
with short and un@@ s@@ pea@@ kable talk , Mrs Di@@ ana is at the same time sex and dynamic , his short soli@@ tary con@@ tras@@ ts with a very challenging gu@@ l@@ f .
his me@@ al is perfect - attractive , but also modest , black gas@@ tron@@ om@@ ic of emphasising the sense of his eyes .
without fear of e@@ re@@ h@@ s , particularly the red , in particular the red , it du@@ mped the do@@ zen to a do@@ g , rather probably the Re@@ v@@ on re@@ d , which then became a br@@ and in some respects .
a few months later , he s@@ ne@@ wed his e@@ leg@@ ant red man@@ ager of a red man in the Netherlands .
the prin@@ ter was a benchmark for healthy and self-@@ confidence .
last but not least , he has full control .
in the days and in the form and in the form of his me@@ als , he will pass on exactly what he wants to think : he is a woman who seems to be at the end of being a woman who seems to have at last found himself in his or her place .
it is a real pity that he was not able to prove it .
the IA@@ A@@ F war@@ ns that the petition will be closely monitored by the London World C@@ up .
on Friday , the World C@@ up will start in London on Friday , and a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are starting more in the spo@@ t@@ light channels than ever before .
these World C@@ up are the first to be gu@@ ar@@ ded by a new body , a@@ th@@ le@@ tic@@ s in@@ te@@ ri@@ t Un@@ it ( A@@ I@@ U ) , which also monit@@ ors corruption , gambling and the falsi@@ fication of results .
it is not possible to rule out that people &apos;s animals will not allow such things to happen .
we can say , however , that we have the best practices and the best anti-@@ d@@ oping programme , which can be at all now , based on information and data collection , and we will see the result after the event &apos; , the A@@ I@@ U representative , David Ho@@ w@@ man .
A@@ I@@ U has allowed 19 a@@ th@@ le@@ tes on 19 a@@ th@@ le@@ tes on 19 a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , who have been caught in a neutral manner .
the le@@ ak@@ ing of the trans@@ cri@@ bes is probably the federal crime , according to former prosecu@@ tors , is probably the federal crime .
who le@@ ak@@ ed to the President &apos;s tru@@ mp@@ s and foreign leaders to the press was likely to cause a crime on Thursday , when the law@@ makers made an appeal to the def@@ end@@ ants of the former prosecu@@ tors on Thursday , when the law@@ makers called an appeal .
&apos;@@ un@@ authorised disclosure of these documents onto the press is a crime &apos; , the former C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia circu@@ lar public prosecu@@ tor , Jo@@ e t@@ en@@ o@@ va Fo@@ rest .
these various acts that involve the signs of conver@@ sa@@ tions between the President and the heads of the foreign country , are a serious threat to national security .
the Washington Po@@ st , on the basis of le@@ ak@@ ed documents , reported to the le@@ ak@@ ed documents at the end of January on the dramatic speeches by the President of Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ EN@@ A N@@ ie@@ to , and the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Prime Minister , Mr Turmes .
the first thing was that the Mexic@@ an state leader was supposed to stop public pro@@ claiming that his government did not pay for the border wall .
according to the newspaper , the trans@@ cri@@ bes contained notes that the National Security Council would have classified them .
the Po@@ st said that the n@@ end@@ en@@ e were able to reach the n@@ am@@ en , which had &apos; made up the White House &apos; , based on the letters from the White House .
&apos;@@ W@@ here is a federal law of the law making it le@@ ak@@ ed to the un@@ authorised person of such classified information to m@@ our@@ n a crime , a federal crime &apos; , the former in New York , D@@ ou@@ g Bur@@ n@@ s .
although some of the details of these speeches had to be made by the public in February , notes the publication of trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts in the White House , who is trying to reduce le@@ aks .
the report was co@@ inci@@ den@@ tal at a time when the leading figures in the wrong administration were , on Friday , prepared to stand up to the public on Friday to demonstrate its commitment to the eradication of classified information to the people of lea@@ gu@@ es .

it is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice will investigate the Po@@ t lea@@ k .
in order to be accountable for this , according to Bur@@ ns , &apos; certain elements have to be clearly demonstrated &apos; .
he said that &apos; on this subject , there may be some wind@@ o@@ ws &apos; , referring to the former Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton , and the decision not to table the accus@@ ation .
these considerations include document labels and history and its precise classification .
in the event of secrecy , prosecu@@ tors will study whether the document was le@@ ak@@ ed to un@@ authorised individuals in a way that is having a negative effect on the interests of the United States .
&apos;@@ I@@ f this can be proven , people can no doubt be crimin@@ ally defen@@ sive &apos; , in Bur@@ ns .
there is no doubt &apos; .
when it comes to the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of telephone calls , the D@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was the Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor of S@@ es@@ ons , that such documents were &apos; generally clas@@ sed as secret and higher &apos; .
by claiming that these le@@ aks are jeopardising the ability of the American Government to move foreign policy , turned to the direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general prosecu@@ tor to bring together a f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist criminal criminal body to find le@@ ak@@ ers .
he also said that , in order to obtain telephone calls and ed@@ it@@ ors of the Washington Po@@ st and ed@@ it@@ ors should be put forward - something against which the depor@@ tations would no doubt be in protest against .
U@@ TA@@ H &apos; Re@@ publi@@ can Sen@@ ator , M@@ ike Le@@ e , said on Thursday in Cap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill that a criminal procedure should be carried out in the case of identifying classified information .
&apos;@@ The person who le@@ ak@@ ed - he has to be punished and , in addition , he must be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed &apos; , Le@@ e F@@ o@@ x , in the name of &apos; A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is unacceptable and this sort of thing should never happen &apos; .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before he was elected to the Senate in 2010 , said that this kind of crime was a &apos; crime &apos; , a very serious federal crime &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at should not and should not be accompanied by just dis@@ mis@@ sal , but also criminal proceedings , given that the confidenti@@ al information is involved , he used to be involved .
it was said to Fo@@ rest Ne@@ ws that , at this stage , the announcement by the Ministry of Justice may give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , not to clarify certain procedures .
last week President S@@ es@@ pensions were openly criticised by President S@@ es@@ pensions and ex@@ pe@@ l@@ ling their an@@ ger publicly against the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor , claiming that the latter has not made enough efforts to find le@@ ak@@ ers .
&apos;@@ I want a Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor to be much more stringent for the le@@ aks that come from the security agencies &apos; , said as true in his ro@@ ses on 25 July .
S@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ s itself admitted the last week to Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws Tu@@ c@@ ker , that he was not satisfied with le@@ aks which have repeatedly challenged the President from his in@@ augu@@ ration .
&apos;@@ I have not been satisfied with the previous procedures and investigations in the criminal le@@ aks &apos; , said &apos; Se@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ s .
even some of the President are taking the floor in the face of some of the President , saying that this is the way in which foreign policy efforts are undermined .
the le@@ ak@@ ing by the President and the head of a foreign country is an outrageous , shocking and dangerous thing &apos; , written David f@@ ru@@ m of at@@ lan@@ tic@@ us on Thursday .
&apos;@@ It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidenti@@ al - and perhaps even more importantly , foreign leaders understand that they can provide a confidenti@@ al answer &apos; .
Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner ( D@@ -@@ V@@ a ) , the leader of the Senate Security Committee , told Da@@ ily B@@ ear@@ on , also said that lea@@ k is &apos; absolutely &apos; worrying &apos; and Congress should look at this .

Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , the officer of the United States of America , John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , says that he received a letter from the T@@ al@@ va@@ de S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood , in which he will be asked to take the form of the next national flag or face a punishment .
he said to the W@@ C@@ TV that he is not going to give in , and has submitted appeals , without the fight .
I am , frankly , taking it as a bul@@ ly &apos; , said A@@ ck@@ er@@ t .
and I think that people should fight against any form of bul@@ lying , in particular .
A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that the alliance of hom@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness is not in line with S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood &apos;s head@@ line values .
in the words of the United States na@@ vy , John A@@ ck@@ ert , said that he had the opportunity to remove its post surroun@@ ded surroun@@ dings in the area of the American flag .
due to the approach of the end of the Hol@@ iness season , we are asking you to take the floor in the surroun@@ dings around the American flag on the American flag &apos; , the letter sent out .
they may be out of 30 days before and , after 15 days at the latest , they will have to be taken out of 15 days at the latest .
he said that there have been four years outside the surroun@@ dings .
it has been there in 30 days &apos; time , after a move to a house .
the messages to the S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood &apos;s housing union did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning .

why should patri@@ otic be present in their own country ?
Ms P@@ A@@ T@@ EU said : &apos; it is a ve@@ ter@@ man who served our country .

I do not think that is the right thing to do .

this report : Mu@@ el@@ ler called for an investigation into the work of older men in a study with Russia .
the &apos; Wall S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal announced on Thursday that the Special Pro@@ secu@@ tor of D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s possible links between Russia and Don@@ al@@ d , has invited the whole of the elderly men .
the page states that the whole of older men is a new and significant step forward in the investigation by the Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor , Robert Mu@@ el@@ ler , on the question of whether or not his main advi@@ sers to promote the P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential of the re@@ public@@ s of 201@@ 6 .
in the past , N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws had previously announced that , before Mu@@ el@@ ler , the Director of the F@@ B@@ I , who is now cha@@ iring this critical investigation , the public prosecu@@ tors were appointed by public prosecu@@ tors from the former National Security advi@@ ser , Michael F@@ ly@@ n@@ n , and the former head of the campaign , Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ t , as part of the investigation into the activities of the former campaign leader , Mr M@@ ana@@ for@@ t , as part of the investigation into the activities of the former E@@ le@@ ction , Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ s .
one of the personal lawyers of the President , John D@@ O@@ W@@ D , said to N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws , said to N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws , he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using older men .
&apos;@@ We have worked together with Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler and his team since 1 June , because we want to get that matter &apos; , he said .
in the light of the news of the news of the total sum@@ mon@@ ing of the ages of the ages , we have no reason to think that the President is under investigation &apos; .
N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has not confirmed the J@@ our@@ nal &apos;s data independently .
the use of older men is a normal part of a complicated investigation , and it is not a tool that aims only to listen to testi@@ mon@@ ies , but also to obtain information and data from individuals or businesses .
it is a powerful tool that prosecu@@ tors can take advantage of the request for prosecu@@ tions and the judiciary , and it can be indicated that the work of Mu@@ el@@ ler is still far from being done .
the tru@@ ck has denied that he or any member of his team during the 201@@ 6 presidential campaign in 201@@ 6 .
the Moscow officials have also denied playing a role as a sha@@ m in the surprising victory last November .
the President &apos;s special ad@@ vis@@ or , T@@ y C@@ ob@@ b , said he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using a new prison@@ er for old men .
&apos;@@ The collection of older men is usually a secret &apos; , C@@ ob@@ b , said in the statement .
the White House is in favour of everything that spe@@ eds up the completion of his work fairly .
the White Group is fully committed to working with the Mu@@ el@@ ler .
the former Director of the F@@ B@@ I , J@@ im Com@@ e@@ y , has stated three times that the President is not under investigation , and we have no reason to think that things have changed &apos; .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Investment Bank is accused of large-scale abuses of money la@@ undering .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Government came out against the country &apos;s largest mortgage on Thursday in large-scale infringements of the rules against money la@@ undering and terrorism financing on Thursday .

according to the Agency , the Bank has committed 53 700 abuses of money la@@ undering and terrorist financing , particularly with regard to the so-called &apos; intelligent In@@ ves@@ ti@@ ga@@ es &apos; .
the previous largest case of this type was previously associated with the P@@ us@@ ula@@ r bet@@ ting in A@@ us@@ tri@@ an , the most popular bet@@ ting , Mr Hol@@ ding , who had just 108 alleged violations .

two influential women share the secre@@ ts of success .
what is joint on Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an@@ i and Mrs A@@ l ?
at first sight these women come from two completely different world .
the New York property cam@@ era , Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an , has been able to conver@@ t a loan of USD 1 billion a decent building of five billion , before implementing his expertise on the T@@ hea@@ k by participating in the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s gra@@ ce of the A@@ B@@ C , the &apos; S@@ har@@ k Ad@@ k &apos; of the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s gra@@ ce of investors &apos; pan@@ els in the A@@ B@@ C &apos; pan@@ el of investors &apos; pan@@ els .
in the foot@@ steps of her father , La@@ ila Ali has been going to follow his father by being a four@@ -@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able champion of women , before his addi@@ tions were still the roles of the television leader , the author and the speaker .
in spite of their unique career paths ( or perhaps perhaps due to them ) T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x , the latter , T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x , in order to help them talk about the up@@ set of stereotypes and the achievement of the ambitious objectives .
last year , T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x spoke to women in the shops in the shops and found that 80 % of them feel that society has given them more ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ pical roles and expectations .
as a result , they come from the Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , in order to help women to break up these barriers .
there are many lessons to be known to Cor@@ cor@@ is and the A@@ U know much about it ; they may be at the top of my area now , but the journey there was not a smooth one for them .
Mr Cor@@ cor@@ an received Central schools and the College mainly came to D@@ i and had already worked on 20 years of age in the age of 2@@ 3-@@ year-old .
he entered one of the most male areas and , in addition , he stood up his way to try to take up his father &apos;s head , who was the top of the i@@ ko@@ on .
these two mil@@ len@@ i@@ es are bo@@ the@@ red by the knowledge acquired by difficulties .
that is why we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming the failures , cop@@ ing with success and trust in their business and relations .
which is insp@@ iring you to do what you are working on every day ?
La@@ va@@ a Ali : I am motivated by my personal goals every day .
I have sha@@ ped the ha@@ bit of writing things that I want to achieve .
and I look at the list .
I find myself responsible .
I am of course insp@@ iring my children .
I have the ambition to insp@@ ire me .
I would like to be vic@@ tori@@ ous in everything that I do in my life .
I understand that achieving my objectives requires a hard job , but I am prepared to do so .
my confidence stems from the preparation .
therefore , I take a lot of time to prepare .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : as I do , it is a key to my confidence being prepared , but I do not draw our inspiration from it .
I am , in fact , inspired by the hard cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what happens if I do so ?
what will remain , if I do not do so ?
this cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity leads me to rise from the margin in the morning , because I cannot afford to wait what the day brings with ourselves .
if I do not know in a few days , I simply pre@@ tend to make these feelings .
then , then , I will believe in my own sense , and I can take inspiration again .
talk about a few concessions in their career , which made you much better in the long term .
Mrs Cor@@ chi@@ an : for me , it was the most difficult to me when my business partner left me in the mar@@ ch and my secre@@ tari@@ al mar@@ ch .
I ended up a business year later , but it was a year of my life - the fifth whe@@ at - was dreadful , because I did not have enough confidence to leave .
I felt sub@@ stitu@@ ted , there was no inspiration .
but the amaz@@ ing thing is happening .
it is most difficult to believe in this moment when you hit the set@@ backs .
it was an extremely difficult year , a year , a year , a year that has taken a year was extremely difficult .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I would say that my career was the most difficult time when I was involved in han@@ ging , I was at the top of my career and decided to give the divorce .
I was not only separated from my hus@@ band , but also from the customs mountain and a man who taught me all I know about bo@@ xing .
I did not believe that I could do without him .
so I have had to worry about the future of my career and I had to find time to take a step back and say to myself : &apos; you have all the necessary knowledge and experience .
you have all these experiences in the bo@@ y circu@@ l .
you will undoubtedly be able to do so &apos; .
so I made a new team around myself and I went on my own career .
in fact , it was simply necessary to achieve the right state of mind , because all the rest was given the impetus there .
I did what was needed , I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my hus@@ band and the p@@ ound and to continue with my career , and everyone resolved .
when did you feel that you were really successful ?
to Mr Ali : I felt that I have achieved success when I won my title of the first champi@@ on@@ ship .
it was a really good feeling , because , starting with the han@@ ging , I wanted to be one of the best , that I wanted to be .
I have succeeded in achieving this goal , and I did not win the title of the champi@@ on@@ ship , not one , but four times .
Mrs Cor@@ chi@@ an : one moment when I felt that I had made progress , my ele@@ ven years of operation was in my 11 years of operation .
I was at the end of the day .
I had earned some 42 000 dollars a profit , which I was not able to expect .
I went out straight away and bought a new car both for the mother and the father , and they never had a new car , and they had never had a new car , and they had never had a new car .
I felt like the Qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I felt so bri@@ lli@@ ant .
I will take much more than that in the coming years , but nothing has been able to offer the same sense as the opportunity to give our parents something back and striking them with surprise .
how did you , in the course of this 1@@ 1-@@ year-old period , to keep working in order to continue working ?
I did not measure my business as a result of profit , because it was not my aim .
I simply wished to see how far I am able to achieve .
I set myself a dream on the first day to receive the New York D@@ ig@@ n@@ ity R@@ ight on the very first day .
and I saw myself as a spiri@@ tual as a p@@ ound - all of my che@@ ek and che@@ ese me .
it was such a little idea in my head .
so , when I pressed every day , every hour , I did not really mean to serve the money .
finally , I did not get the money ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal .
but all the money that came into being , I immediately turned back to business .
I do not even believe that I had a da@@ un@@ ting days at all , where I would have thought that o@@ h God , we are not serving money .
I simply had the belief that something was going to work .
the worst thing that could happen would have been the removal of the company and going back again .
I will have a good drin@@ k and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
therefore , I do not believe that there is a great deal of ambition for people that has made a great deal of progress .
they have other incentives that inci@@ te them .
and the money was not one of my own .
do you have any advice to someone who has such great dre@@ ams , but who are being held back by a financial factor ?
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : when I was going to earn a lot of money , I had money to invest in property , but I did not have time .
I made a firm in R@@ i@@ k@@ n@@ n@@ n .
and that is why I found myself with five different partners who were not even in specialists in the bro@@ ke@@ l , but in the various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds everywhere in different neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , who felt through our streets and in the bur@@ th .
I have taken note to them , and I said : &apos; you know this neighbourhood .
I think I have the best building .
I will give you the money and you will become my partner : &apos;
the lesson here is that , if you have money , you leave the people to earn money with their money .
and if you have an tal@@ ent , you can sell it to someone who has the money , and it would earn money .
there are two aspects here : An@@ ne and money .
however , if you have not done so , then nothing will happen very much .
ultimately , I have - and also my partners - in all these years , together with these major investors that I would never have ever had if I did not have the courage to find com@@ mo@@ dit@@ ist people who would like to take up .
it is always possible to obtain money when the belief that you have an an@@ ger and to feel better than anyone in the world .
what are we talking about this morning : what are the two or three things that you do every morning to help you succeed ?
La@@ ila Ali : I do not know about you , but I do have a lot of time in my life , when I feel over-@@ burden@@ ed , being a mother , a business , the hus@@ band ... all the roles we play as women .
I arrive at a point in my life where I really had to put this morning in place .
I like to stand up and simply feel a great deal of gratitude .
gratitude for the up@@ ris@@ ings , for our health , for their children , for their own family .
I often write up the evening , which is my objectives for the next day , and , if I wake up , I will look again at the list .
Mr Me@@ di@@ ta@@ in .
sometimes I am writing in days .
the line has always been taken out of the po@@ cket .
and always the first thing I did in the morning because , if I do not do so , it will remain without it .
for me , at the end of the day , it is a matter of priorities .
these are things that I consider to be important : in my spi@@ ra@@ cy , a focus on the uni@@ verse and God , then training and putting our health first .
that would be the simple thing to do with this .
I feel able to con@@ qu@@ er all the challenges that come in my way in the course of a day .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : I place a point of order for that to happen .
I am working through a list of tasks that is endless and ridiculous .
and put in place , which is the most important thing .
what are the real priorities ?
I will try to accept these most important things .
what do you do to bring ourselves a major meeting in the right state of emergency ?
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : I am failing to fail .
that is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , if not .
I think that the I@@ ss@@ and , I am failing .
Mr H@@ ir@@ mu@@ tan , and this makes me more effort .
I can imagine anyone who is in competition with me - I am very con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous by nature , because I am one of ten children and we could never get the attention of our parents sufficiently .
I can be very con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous .
and I will always come back too carefully .
I am going to strengthen the self-@@ confidence of me .
La@@ us@@ a Ali : it is amaz@@ ing that we are in this respect .
we have two successful people , and this shows how different things are working for different people .
I am pleased to see that I am successful .
I am pleased to see the end , which is a success .
I can imagine that in the spirit of mind , I actually see it happening .
as I have always done , I see the struggle going , the fight to take place , to take ourselves off the w@@ rec@@ k and the return of the clothing space to celebrate a piece of co@@ g@@ is , as I have always done .
the same applies to meetings .
I will , however , always prepare themselves in depth ; this self-@@ confidence stems precisely from the preparation because , in the cl@@ oud , the fear is that I do not go well or I do not know the right things or do not have the necessary information .
that is where I come from the preparation of this game .
however , I am always entering into the final outcome .
you have both been very successful in your career .
how will you pass on that ?
La@@ ila Ali : I am very exc@@ iting that I can be part of T@@ .@@ J@@ . M@@ A@@ X@@ X@@ I from the Ma@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , because I feel that this is an opportunity to do so .
a great many women need to insp@@ ire , to encourage them to pursue their dre@@ ams and objectives .
that is all of the ch@@ em@@ pi@@ res .
it is , in fact , a matter of urgency and of having the necessary tools , surroun@@ ded ourselves with the right people , people who have been able to achieve what you are trying to achieve .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : one of the things I am doing very well in my opinion is to insp@@ ire people .
that is why I was very ex@@ cited when I was invited to work with Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
I will try to take the form of the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and inspiration that we see in all these people here and give them practical advice on how to move forward .
many people are making the start of their dre@@ ams , but they tend to be wrong in some points .
so we are trying to help them to focus on the cause .
everything we teach is practical .
an issue that is as easy as the lif@@ ts , everything that is needed to set up a company .
what advice would you give to women who want to make progress in male areas ?
La@@ ila Ali : I am acting in one of the most male areas , which is a han@@ k .
to come after my father , who was the best of the world of i@@ ko@@ on and all times , was quite discoura@@ ging .
for me , the cru@@ x of the matter was actually to find its tal@@ ent , courage , strength in self-@@ sufficiency .
the first thing I would like to do was to believe that I can get round and succeed .
at the time , nobody else was concerned about me and there were no restrictions on my way , other than those of which I had myself set up for myself .
if you believe in ourselves and find their passion , no one can stand in the way .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : the road to find an inspiration and having a attitude like me - the &apos; New York D@@ ig@@ n@@ ity Qu@@ es@@ te - and there is a huge amount of time between overcoming the New York D@@ ig@@ n@@ ity .
and in this interim phase , which is a day of your career career every day , there is a lot of tal@@ ent .
in order to obtain these tal@@ ent , we do not have to act with property ag@@ endas .
I am sure that in the area of La@@ ila , it was also necessary to decide what the right people are , the right na@@ u@@ gh@@ ters as to begin when to put an end , a lot of money , which can be put in what can be put in place , which is not how difficult they are prepared to work .
these are all subjec@@ tive decisions .
I am trying to make these efforts slightly more robust , so that these women really feel : &apos; no , I have now understood .
let me try .
here are the three main priorities .
when they leave the three main priorities so that things really do happen , I will go back home in home with s@@ mi@@ le at home .
what is your night at your night at the moment ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : too much of a f@@ ool .
the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , books , small pal@@ m , my day .
it is probably on the water supply .
Mrs Cor@@ chi@@ an : my night has a small green ti@@ p of the green light , because I tried to break the ha@@ bit every morning the first thing to look at the phone .
that is why I pro@@ cu@@ red that .
it was in a hur@@ ry .
but that has never worked .
and still stands there .
and my phone is still on my night .
what books are you going to read now ?
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : E@@ igh@@ th or n@@ in@@ th times , &apos; Ho@@ w to become friends and to influence the people &apos; .
that keeps me on the right track .
I think that is still the best book that has been written in this area , which is not written in this area , which is what you dre@@ ams and dre@@ ams cannot be achieved without the people of others .
and this makes it possible to get into contact today in exactly the same way as it did in the past .
I like to read it out at times .
this will help me to get on the right track again .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : learn at the di@@ ary school , which is why I read the book &apos; N@@ et free di@@ e@@ om@@ et &apos; .
it is about the eating of cereals and how they affect our body .
I am very interested in this .
what is your best advice to deal with the successes and failures of success ?
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : ignore the la@@ undering .
they encounter all sorts of different forms .
you have to remove their bra@@ ins from their mouth .
keep the v@@ ans out of the b@@ ag@@ s .
they are a mira@@ cle you out of energy empty .
I take the side of the stri@@ pp@@ ers as a the@@ ft .
they will come at night , s@@ ounding your w@@ alle@@ ts and de@@ par@@ tures .
the pessimis@@ ts will destroy the cre@@ w more quickly than you can look at your eyes , because people who are pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate themselves , want others to feel badly .
they are attra@@ cting good people with themselves .
I can perfectly avoid all the negative people in the scope of 50 km , because my aim is to be positive and to have everything to do and to pass everything I have to offer .
so why do I want to ask for a minute to spend a minute on these people ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : there must be consistency .
we will start with many times with conviction that we are now taking this path .
let us do it and that is what we are doing .
however , people do not follow this long enough .
sometimes they give them just before they end up in the last .
so I think that we need to stay on course .
if you feel passion for something , they believed in something , then you will have to be consistent .
and the hard work that the success requires .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : a great deal of effort must be made to ensure continuity .
do you know what is needed to do so ?
that is how things are completed .
if you start with something , then it will stop .
there are many who are some of the foundations , but not a few gradu@@ ates .
Chinese Internet cen@@ sors have complex bo@@ xes and hi@@ ro@@ use in China .
according to the experts , there is a reference to a shift that can affect many users from certain users to businesses , that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet .
&apos;@@ It seems that restrictions are becoming more and more intense , but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever &apos; , the E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , the E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , the E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , who has written a book entitled &apos; D@@ ho in Com@@ ra@@ des &apos; , which deals with the influence of the Internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
the restrictions placed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China .
according to the experts , China &apos;s control has not yet strengthened the control of China and , in many cases , the game of c@@ at and mo@@ use will continue .
one day after A@@ pp@@ le , the people last week started to spread in the Chinese social media the way in which access to these tools , which is so simple that it is even technical .
this involved the registration of a bo@@ y of human applications to another country where the V@@ PA applications are still available .
nevertheless , on a Thursday , China wants to change the game in favour of the c@@ at .
a number of providers of Internet services in China have said on Thursday in their social media accounts , on websites , or by us , that Chinese security officials will test a new way to find their services online , which will care or use illegal content .
once they have been found , the authorities are asking the authorities to say that Internet service providers would require their customers to stop this activity .
when the customers continue , service providers and Chinese officials inter@@ rupt these Community minutes .
the Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a comment by the Ministry of Public Security .
studies suggest that tens of millions of people in China use V@@ P@@ N@@ s and other type of sof@@ tw@@ are to escape from a large number of lights .
even though the clo@@ sures of foreign television broadcas@@ ts and por@@ no@@ graph@@ y , many people are leaving off , they are putting China with an ex@@ pon@@ ential amount of online users &apos; community .
the Chinese President , X@@ I J@@ in@@ p@@ ing , has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet over the years , but he has also raised the technology and the Internet as a critical factor in China &apos;s future economic development .
as cyber@@ space has begun to play a more central role in terms of what is happening in China , government control le@@ vers have evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to identify the extent of the new efforts , as many users and businesses are not openly discussing them in public , fe@@ aring the Chinese Government &apos;s compli@@ city .
however , some frequent users have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to escape the limitations .
one student who is stu@@ dying in the United States and na@@ iling to spend his summer holiday in China , said that he had been blocked by the local V@@ P@@ N .
he said that he took the period as a kind of me@@ di@@ age beyond the social media and he left F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k to his friends to explain why he has been under the ground .
a woman from a Chinese university doc@@ tr@@ ary has said that , without Google having become research , it has become more difficult to carry out research , even though the university has found alternative publi@@ cations so that students do not always need the Internet .
according to itself , he has now found a new way of by@@ passing , without dis@@ playing , which is what it is .
according to the Chinese Internet observers , some of the V@@ P@@ As are still working , and China would be able to do much more to intensify restrictions .
&apos;@@ We believe that , if the government had decided to do so , it would have now stopped much more use of V@@ P@@ N &apos; , V@@ P@@ N@@ A , the website created in 2015 , which will help the Chinese users to V@@ P@@ N for a V@@ P@@ I .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the government had sent out more , the Chinese would be much more complicated &apos; , the representative who refused to give himself to China because of the delicate nature of the work of the group .
&apos;@@ apparently they did not do so because they have to leave people or businesses a little brea@@ thing space &apos; .
Chinese online restrictions are often cyclical .
the current atmosphere is partly due to the important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party , which is the 19@@ th party of the 19@@ th party .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ N came to an un@@ foreseen inter@@ ruption at that time .
like economic policy or external affairs , censorship are also part of a difficult and often inadequate political process in China .
according to the analy@@ sts , the government departments , in the run-up to Congress , feel that they are effective and able to intervene in the event .
&apos;@@ This is certainly not in the V@@ P@@ C a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ se &apos; , the head of the Global For@@ ce For@@ ce , the head of the global technological depart@@ ment , Paul Tri@@ ol@@ o .
the more difficult environment and new opportunities and approaches allow China simply to have a better use of the use of V@@ P@@ D at the elected time of Beijing and to include in the place &apos; , he said .
China &apos;s population is learning earlier on to cope with these difficulties .
earlier this summer , Chinese Internet gi@@ ant , T@@ ene@@ w@@ d , began to limit the time under which the young , as 18 , has been allowed to play a popular web band &apos; , allowing it to be used for an hour by those who are under 12 and two hours for those aged between 12 and 18 .
therefore , China &apos;s young people have begun to make use of the age@@ -@@ old solution - false documents .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat is your &apos; H@@ on@@ or of K@@ ing is being restricted ?
are you interested in having a document which shows that you are older than 18 ? &apos; I asked the Chinese social media ?
it is not a problem .

he was ex@@ tol@@ led on the face of the global cyber attack .
and then he was arrested .
when the bad assets were first adver@@ tised in the Russian d@@ ry in the Russian d@@ ry , the USD 7 000 dollar was considered to be a profit to sell bad assets .
domestic advertising was being adver@@ tised as a ha@@ un@@ ting tool , which is able to obtain data , including users &apos; and car@@ ro@@ t , b@@ os@@ ses and bo@@ gu@@ s , the P@@ E and personal information that is useful in breaking security issues .
on Thursday , M@@ o@@ th@@ er@@ b@@ ard announced on Thursday that the visit of B@@ la@@ ck H@@ a and D@@ ef@@ c@@ is had been held at the port in Hu@@ t@@ ch after the visit by B@@ la@@ ck H@@ a and D@@ ef@@ ca .
he had the intention to fly back home in Britain .
the security community responded by the security community with amaz@@ ement and scepticism .
some warned that the requirements against Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s could undermine the relationship of &apos; false &apos; ha@@ p@@ kers - investi@@ g@@ ators , who are seeking to identify and resolve problems with sof@@ tw@@ are , not to commit or resolve crimes , or between the law enforcement authorities .
others were hesi@@ tant that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ s had a hesi@@ tant to create such sof@@ tw@@ are .
in July 2014 he asked T@@ wit@@ ter , and no one asked the K@@ ron@@ os &apos;s face , which is seem@@ ingly a strange request when he was the author of bad assets .
although the precise details of the substance of the Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s of Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s are not clear , pe@@ er investi@@ ga@@ tive investi@@ ga@@ tors have often ignored legal problems in the search for vulnerable places of the computer code .
in recent years , large te@@ ch@@ og@@ ic@@ es have announced &apos; errors of errors &apos; in order to form@@ alise the problems for researchers and the process of compensa@@ ting for their work .

the long-standing advi@@ ser and leader of D@@ il@@ ne@@ y , Mar@@ ty S@@ glass , died 8@@ 3 years old .
S@@ glass , who died at my home in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Hol@@ ly@@ wood H@@ ill@@ si , who died in my own home in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Hol@@ ly@@ wood H@@ ill@@ si , maintained the link with the company after a pension in 2009 , which was just inspired by the 5@@ 4@@ th anniversary of the opening of the distri@@ ct of the Republic of Mes@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
last year , he became the only tru@@ mp member of S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i &apos;s opening day in China , S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , who has been involved in opening up all the 12 D@@ is@@ n@@ y Par@@ ks across the world .
and , less than two weeks before he died , she was present on the eve of the f@@ ans of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , who was present in the presence of the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
his death was declared by D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y , without mentioning the cause .
he was 8@@ 3-@@ year-old .
the office of S@@ k@@ lar@@ s , the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land Ne@@ ws was a temporary one , but he na@@ a@@ sis D@@ is@@ may@@ land after U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ A@@ . , in 195@@ 6 , to work in this advertising depart@@ ment .
he received the main shadow author from W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y to build the W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , the speeches , slo@@ gan@@ s , slo@@ gan@@ s and presen@@ tations , such as , for example , the written letter , which helped the company to gain discharge for the construction of W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y and E@@ bl@@ or@@ east .
he has worked with Wales and his bro@@ ther Ro@@ y@@ ga , also on the annual reports by Mr D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at were rather pe@@ zz@@ ling people who only came into 30 bir@@ th@@ day and who only had six or seven years after the end of the College , was signed by S@@ k@@ ar in his car bio@@ graph@@ y : M@@ y H@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ C@@ en@@ tur@@ y C@@ en@@ tur@@ y c@@ r@@ ne@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ en@@ tur@@ y c@@ r@@ ne@@ y .
however , despite the fact that W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , in his correspon@@ dence , S@@ k@@ and@@ i , he appointed S@@ k@@ ar@@ i at the New York World War , where D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y developed ex@@ hibi@@ tions and publi@@ cations .
S@@ k@@ ul@@ t wrote W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ th@@ on for the Ma@@ gi@@ c sky , where an S@@ k@@ P wrote to W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ th@@ on , where S@@ k@@ al@@ t wrote to W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ th@@ on , which was their main inter@@ conne@@ ct with large spon@@ sors of large corporations .
it was the start of the second round of S@@ k@@ oo@@ s in an enterprise .
as the head of an ever-increasing Member and I@@ om@@ atic , he was increasingly linked to the legacy of W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , who died at the end of 196@@ 6 , a long time before the W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y was opened up in 197@@ 1 and the E@@ fil@@ t@@ t .
after the W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s 6@@ 5-@@ year-old bir@@ d because of the l@@ ung cancer , S@@ glass was returned to a written world when he was told that the company &apos;s senior execu@@ tives had not prepared a public speech , even though &apos; it was no secret that the death of the West was dying &apos; , as he wri@@ tes in his car bio@@ graph@@ y .
the S@@ k@@ ar felt , as he himself said , that he had to write a statement to which Ro@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y wri@@ tes , but he understood that the lack of planning was a sign that the death of W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y had paraly@@ sed the company &apos;s managers .
&apos;@@ in reality , they were all dead in the face of death &apos; , wrote S@@ glass .
Mr Adri@@ an S@@ glass was born in February , in New B@@ r@@ s@@ w@@ ick in New J@@ er@@ se@@ y .
her father , Le@@ on was a teacher and a mother , a ne@@ na@@ u@@ pro@@ sc@@ ent , L@@ il@@ y@@ n F@@ u@@ ch@@ s , was employed by the company J@@ oh@@ n@@ son &amp; J@@ oh@@ n@@ son before a family home to L@@ ong Be@@ ong in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , when Mar@@ ty was 12 .
after secondary school he had a number of temporary jobs , for example , he was working in D@@ ou@@ g@@ l@@ as Air@@ cra@@ f@@ tis , as a h@@ amb@@ ur@@ a ch@@ amb@@ ur@@ a in his hands as well as a super@@ market for postal services .
however , in May 195@@ 5 , when his third year in U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ A@@ s was coming to an end , S@@ glass has received the message that he would call the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y marketing and advertising leader E@@ . Car@@ d@@ on Wales .
at that time , S@@ glass U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ A@@ . The head of the Da@@ ily B@@ ru@@ in , was the new head active .
he has asked him to come to a working inter@@ view to the creat@@ or and his ed@@ it@@ or in Ne@@ ws for a creat@@ or and his ed@@ it@@ or &apos;s office .
Wales said that this dossier will soon be opened .
and that needs him .
he , in fact , be@@ ap@@ t him after 20 minutes of an inter@@ view .
however , S@@ k@@ ar also had to prove to Mr D@@ is@@ n@@ y that he knows what he is doing .
&apos;@@ I had been working there for two weeks and I had to present the W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s report &apos; , reminded him of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ ue on his website .
&apos;@@ if it had not preferred to Wales , he would have thrown me out of the door and made a professional .
fortunately , fortunately , I welcomed Wales .
I was 21 .
it was horri@@ ble .
I never had been working on a professional level &apos; .
lessons from W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , and also to some other people ) , for one minute &apos;s ten comm@@ and , or perhaps the manifes@@ to of the Bureau of the Pro@@ ce@@ du@@ ce .
the orders include , for example , the following .
the attempt to &apos; enter the sho@@ es of the visitors &apos; so as to experience a life as they do .
there is only one story in any con@@ qu@@ est for each party .
the &apos; bo@@ y le@@ ar@@ k &apos; , Mr R@@ og@@ ers called the S@@ k@@ lar@@ i order called S@@ k@@ ik@@ h@@ i , a role that M@@ ik@@ i Hi@@ ir played the role of the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y film in D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos; ( 19@@ 40 ) , as she had bro@@ the@@ red by D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s philosophy of the three generations of L@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
he is left behind his hus@@ band , ne@@ i@@ u@@ ja@@ bro@@ k@@ k@@ y , L@@ es@@ li@@ e S@@ glass , the son of L@@ es@@ li@@ e S@@ glass , son Ho@@ w Ho@@ ws and four children .
S@@ glass was a dedicated leader of the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
he perio@@ dic@@ ally targeted the M@@ ala@@ i-@@ Hi@@ use : which showed him in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , in Paris and T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o ) and the M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ use &apos;s gol@@ den work .
and he never forgotten what W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y had taught him .
when the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y developed a C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia Ad@@ d@@ tur@@ dy , the S@@ k@@ ard C@@ P reminded the plan@@ ners of the S@@ k@@ ig@@ r , to include activities that parents and children could do together , as Mr D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had requested .
&apos;@@ I reminded everyone that the D@@ is@@ the@@ y@@ land existed even because it was the case that Wales was custom@@ ary to lead his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Di@@ an@@ e Di@@ al and S@@ har@@ n@@ it G@@ ri@@ ff@@ i@@ th , said to the press in The T@@ ary L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , who said in T@@ ary L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , &apos; and father had to sit on the ground and the &apos; and man had to sit on par@@ k and han@@ g . to eat , until children go alone &apos; .
he thought that a fellow Member &apos;s hard interest has been given .
but why was his symp@@ toms so different ?
at the Th@@ oo@@ home point , he was given a great do@@ se to me@@ ter tur@@ f .
for the rest of the day , he was inter@@ viewed , rus@@ hed , sor@@ ted and rese@@ ar@@ ched .
none of the people demonstrated anything , but he was also not found to send home .
he understood the cause .
for the past two years , she had taken a drug from S@@ j@@ ö@@ g@@ ren@@ i sy@@ nd@@ ro@@ me for treating a drug called &apos; e@@ than@@ er &apos; .
the treatment reduces the capacity of the immun@@ e system , and it restricted its capacity to combat infection .
S@@ j@@ ö@@ m@@ gre@@ n is a crime of honour , a rather my@@ ste@@ rious disease , with the body of white c@@ ron@@ ies , as if it were an inva@@ sive body that is so@@ aring out of the chaos in this case , which produces te@@ ars and wind@@ s , and some ar@@ mi@@ es , as well as in some ar@@ mi@@ es .
wee@@ kly ther@@ ap@@ y e@@ than@@ om@@ a had been helpful by reducing the excessive pain .
however , he knew that it was rather hel@@ l in the event of a serious infection .
when the at@@ tain@@ ment started to function , the patient felt much better than it was .
Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ ment doctors decided to leave a night of the hospital .
when it comes to a virus , like the doctors &apos; suspect , it will be in order next day to him and he is going to go home .
if Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was first in my new patient bul@@ let , he has led himself to an infection , to which the people of the e@@ than@@ er are sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this list was a long one .
we cannot cure the diagnosis before being treated , so he focused on bac@@ teri@@ a .
one bac@@ teri@@ um , which attacks the people of im@@ mig@@ ra@@ tions , is a food addi@@ tive one .
this is often found in the un@@ te@@ na@@ ted milk and che@@ ese , and it causes terrible birth , con@@ st@@ in@@ acy and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea that he did not have .
the domestic business disease is the second infection , which is widespread among the pro@@ tag@@ onists , but it did not miss the bel@@ l or the air .
an ever more widespread bac@@ teri@@ um Sta@@ phy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ cus can lead to a disproportionate infection , but , again , he did not have excessive complaints .
despite this , it is intended to begin a wide range of antibio@@ tic treatment , covering all these threats .
however , it was not felt that he could come to gri@@ ps with a serious infection .
Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ ce doctors had not given antibiotics to him .
a doctor had the opportunity to dra@@ g out with the man@@ ure of antibiotics and simply to monitor and wait , but if the patient had to have one of the infection that he had read would even have a couple of hours a delay to death by a few hours .
the situation was made even more complicated by the fact that the patient thought he had aller@@ gic to a pen@@ ny line , although he did not remember what happened when he took it .
this created the risk and benefit from the shift of relationship .
the decision normally with low contributions as to whether or not to start an antibio@@ tic treatment will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked my fellow Member , the second resident , to assess the patient .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard did not say to my colleague that he was proposing an antibio@@ tic cure ; he has simply asked to review the patient and make a suggestion .
my fellow Member met with the patient and agreed .
although he saw good , he would be virtually defence@@ less in the case of infection .
the doctor should give antibiotics to the patient .
since the patient has had an aller@@ gy on the pen@@ al line , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard should allow her to test in order to check whether he is tole@@ rating a drug that is not pen@@ al , but a close relatives .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard asked me to man@@ g a the@@ at@@ ch .
if he had a serious response to the medicine , he would have got a blow or his blood pressure would have gone .
neither has happened .
that is why he was given a holistic d@@ oo@@ t .
a few hours later , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was given a speech .
the body temperature of the patient has risen to 39 degrees .
he has@@ tened to take a look at the patient .
a patient &apos;s face on the do@@ or@@ step by the air cel@@ l and the w@@ o@@ ke were the Roma .
although he seemed to be un@@ comfortable , his heart and bloo@@ d@@ shed were all well in his hearts and with blood pressure .
thank you very much to the happ@@ iness that he had given antibiotics to the patient .
he asked to man@@ if@@ est yet another d@@ oo@@ se T@@ y@@ n@@ oli and , if he had to review the patient for the last time , that he was deeply s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated .
the fe@@ ver was re@@ treating .
H@@ ig@@ ine k@@ u@@ mb@@ s and the Roma parts were missing .
next evening , when Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was on his he@@ els in an en@@ vel@@ ope of G@@ ir@@ ard , the first thing that he went to the patient .
he had also received five other patients , but for the sake of this patient Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was most concerned at the G@@ ir@@ ard , after his day cre@@ w , he was most concerned .
during those hours he did not see him , the labor@@ atory had increased his bloody organ@@ ism .
it was still too early to say what this is all about .
what was clear , however , was that it is a bac@@ teri@@ a that is strong enough to quickly grow up , and that it is not the case of Sta@@ phy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ cus or a bon@@ gy disease .
the list of other options was long , and none of them could actually see fit .
it took another two days before they finally managed to identify the bac@@ teri@@ um .
it was an additional ac@@ id .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard , like anyone else who looked after the patient was surprised .
as a doctor , you look at the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff of diseases .
for G@@ ir@@ ar@@ di , an additional disease is a disease that is obtained from the un@@ pac@@ ked milk and soft che@@ ese , and which causes birth , con@@ st@@ in@@ acy and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
he worked through further material on this extraordinary infection and found that , although the ordinary immun@@ e system was able to experience these symp@@ toms , they would normally recover quickly as a patient colleague .
however , in the case of pregnant women , parents and the damaged immun@@ e systems , the infection may be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed outside the ra@@ g@@ ba@@ m - sometimes without showing the usual symp@@ toms - and enter the bloo@@ d@@ shed .
it could spread across the body as a po@@ cket .
this type of infection , which is called on to be a inva@@ sive sur@@ p@@ luses , may result in a death of up to 30 % of the cases of death .
indeed , although this is not as a bo@@ wer , the additional plant can be as dead@@ ly as it is .
early antibio@@ tic treatment can save life .
when it comes to a food transmission disease , what food did the bac@@ teri@@ a ?
while a patient and his colleague were not in the process of a journey for un@@ restra@@ ined milk , nor was his colleague who had consumed soft che@@ ese , the online search , this summer , identified an additional outbreak in Scotland , linked to smo@@ ke@@ red beef .
neither of these has had smo@@ ke@@ red beef fe@@ eds , but they are a little smo@@ ke@@ red gap .
exactly where they were repeating the bac@@ teri@@ a , was turned into secret .
when the doctor of the doctors had learned what the patient was wrong , they were able to adapt antibiotics .
his three-@@ week cure ended in July .
doctors advised him to take it cal@@ mly until the end of the summer , but now he feels quite well and has returned to mu@@ se@@ um and his bel@@ o@@ ved work .
Pakistan &apos;s prices of India will not be able to seek refuge in India .
70 years after the two-@@ state separation , the biggest population migration that began with the separation of the two countries , the price of the biggest population of the population is still going to India .
tens of thousands of people on the border of two countries expect tens of thousands of people on the border of two countries , who do not even have a legal right to work in India .
so many have no choice but to bo@@ il down illegal habi@@ ta@@ ts from illegal habi@@ ta@@ ts from illegal habi@@ ta@@ ts - the Indian authorities , on the other hand , are watching the movements of those who arrive very closely at the border .
the majority of Pakistan will not be able to expect such reception .
there is no work , there is no house , no money , no gu@@ ilt .
there , we worked in generations , we were a be@@ ac@@ on .
here , however , a stone is being forced into sub@@ sis@@ tence to earn a living &apos; , an 8@@ 1-@@ year-old J@@ og@@ is@@ s , of an 8@@ 1-@@ year-old J@@ og@@ ta .
for us , no division is over .
they are still trying to return to their country .
and when they come here they do not have anything &apos; , an elderly man living near the city of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ el@@ i .
after India &apos;s independence from British colonial powers in 19@@ 47 , over 15 million people lost their homes in 19@@ 47 .
separation caused a wave of violence from months to violence , in which at least one million people lost their lives due to religious hatred .
in the middle of a bloody chaos , prices and S@@ ik@@ h@@ s emerged from Pakistan , Muslims moved in the opposite direction .
despite emig@@ ration , Pakistan is still one of the numerous minority groups in Pakistan .
according to various estimates , they account for around 1.@@ 6 % of the country &apos;s population of 200 million .
many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear of abduc@@ tion , rape and forced marriages .
the persecution started soon after parti@@ tion &apos; , in J@@ og@@ da , who had a family only a few months before two countries &apos; diver@@ gence to drought in the areas of Pakistan .
it was not the day that we could have lived in peace .
I wanted to come back to live in the middle of our prices .
the Indian Prime Minister , N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra &apos;s national government , has said that it wants to make asylum without those who are persecuted for religious reasons in India .
last year , the government started to allow immigrants to apply their citizenship in their own place , in the past , all the costs via the central government .
the prices which have relo@@ cated from Pakistan to India will open up after seven years of residence in a country after seven years of residence .
however , due to bureaucratic delays , this process is often more time-@@ consuming .
the 6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ in@@ j@@ i , of 64 years , left Pakistan in 1997 and received Indian citizenship in 2005 .
he said , however , many have abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not waiting for a good life in India .
the government offers no support .
we are like the livestock of the cattle without the ow@@ ner .
we are simply trying to survive on their own right &apos; , let K@@ han@@ ar@@ m@@ in .
however , even worse than that of poverty , there is the scepticism of the authorities .
those who do not have citizenship have to suffer harassment from intelligence agencies .
they are systematically treated as agents of the suspect and Pakistani agents &apos; , explained it .

Mr K@@ ü@@ r@@ k : Mr Putin , for a whole year , so there would not be a holiday .
I was , of course , personally responsible for the fact that this leave was not cle@@ ared .
I , too , was somewhat necessary to have an employee but , at the same time , I think the only one who has been irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
for ourselves , the blame is that the l@@ ol@@ la@@ x con@@ scienti@@ ous to my bre@@ ed .
the quote from this House at the beginning of this Chamber is good for the fact that it is completely true .
this was the case , the new agency , with which I started the same year in March , called for a lot of work , but something in the job of this job was so much better to me in order to have a completely new life in three months .
there is a summer , a period of summer , of holidays .
it is time to make new@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ on-@@ year pled@@ ges to see what has happened in life and in what direction the whole thing is han@@ ging .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat is the Christmas and the year : &apos; now , a few decent citizens are now dis@@ missing .
perhaps it is , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas is not fit for thinking and setting targets .
well , I am speaking only for myself - I will not be able to make any changes at the time of the year .
that is too difficult to my mind .
of course , at Christmas time there are happ@@ iness and jo@@ y : I like knowledge of the f@@ at@@ ty victory that is starting , I like Christmas , and also J@@ es@@ us had every sympathy with g@@ loom@@ y attitudes , a revolu@@ tionary attitude .
despite this , I am , in most cases , very ti@@ red , and sometimes stressed , - for the sake of the dar@@ k@@ ness that has already occurred .
yes , I do a lot of work when living on holiday , perhaps even more than I would be at the slaugh@@ ter@@ house in the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and I have consistently got out of hand .
most of all , in the run-up to Christmas , I have run in the run-up to Christmas - gi@@ f@@ ts , at least four Christmas pi@@ ves , a slightly higher work@@ load at work ...
if you take into account the un@@ stop@@ p@@ able social pressure in the face of the un@@ stop@@ p@@ able social pressure and peace , the difficulties of the Christmas period are evident .
however , a people who are desperate and ti@@ red of will be unable to make good decisions , let alone improve them .
such things have to be made with a more or less clear head .
a ti@@ red person is perhaps thro@@ wing into an empty and res@@ ounding commitment that , when it comes to laying the foundations for the future , something like the purchase of a lo@@ t@@ tery ticket .
a commitment , which is intended to change anything , should be cal@@ mly thought through , it should be a plan .
the plan , in contrast to the promise , also contains a code of practice and does not go to a few or a few set@@ backs following an attempt .
that is why I am saying that the best time for breaking promises is now in the summer .
it is simply a cal@@ mer to break out and to the arms , why it is as much as it is ( if it is .
if you do not oblige yourself to be allowed to be ro@@ cked off during a period of leave , then you will have to find a few weeks in order to find their lives into a place that deserves to be en@@ cro@@ ac@@ hed , and to find out exactly how it can be done .
I consider it important to live as far as possible that there is no need for a holiday , not once a year .
so that leave is an additional audit , not a bo@@ x@@ ine for survival , where the bo@@ xes are to be lo@@ aded so much so as to be able to with@@ stand the next year in any way .
I would like to make a promise of at least one simple w@@ o@@ ke - if you have to rise at a certain time at a certain time , you will be able to go to s@@ lee@@ p in good time next morning .
I believe that , if one in 10 to hear my suggestion , I think that life would be considerably improved in Estonia .
I myself intend to go to my own advice .
such attempts to k@@ ni@@ fe the people of this kind .
it would be a very good thing if you could think further and draw conclusions .
the recommendation for a little more time to spend a little more time to be spent on the background of the deliberate background .
more generally , however , everyone can have a strategy that he shares about itself in the social media .
at national level , however , we need to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats to the social media .
the life expectancy of people created under controlled conditions ended in summer school , but it is certainly not the business of the gu@@ ilt .
the fourth Est@@ onian people got a b@@ reat@@ h in Finland .
together with the Finnish media , along with Finnish media , who took part in the section of the Finnish media ( P@@ ER@@ H ) , the H@@ ü@@ n@@ ter T@@ em@@ k , a car@@ di@@ o@@ k@@ ur@@ a , G@@ ü@@ r T@@ em@@ k , has estimated that the post-@@ operational period has been carried out .
it is very difficult to say how long the patient had been able to live with the new heart &apos; , spoke of the P@@ le@@ der .
according to doctors , the world has now been living in a b@@ reat@@ h for a maximum of eight years in the world .
the man himself is reco@@ vering and is not prepared to talk about it .
he was diagno@@ sed with the heart of the first two years ago , and the disease was already at the end stage , was at the end stage .
&apos;@@ for that sick , transplantation was the only option &apos; , added to Thailand .
in the words of the Car@@ di@@ ci@@ k@@ ur@@ a , patients no longer had any wind@@ o@@ ws accompanied by a car@@ ro@@ l after a transplant .
it will have only a ro@@ ck and w@@ o@@ ke of immunity .
a patient can make sport and live in general as the ordinary person &apos; , she spoken .
the first year is the most dangerous one .
in writing . - ( NL ) Mr President , in the words that full recovery will take three to six months .
according to both doctors , the patient must regularly monitor the introduction of a regular number ; at the same time , the medicines have side@@ -@@ effects .
in addition , the patient must get in check to avoid a structural response from the donor .
the most dangerous is the first year , but the IS@@ H@@ L@@ T , the International Soci@@ ety for Health and Education , live in excess of 50 % of patients for more than 10 years .
I said that in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , the results are better and the long@@ est for the rest have been lived with a transplant for 25 years .
the Car@@ di@@ o@@ sur@@ a@@ sur@@ ge explained that , because of the disease , the patient &apos;s blood b@@ el@@ der was po@@ ison@@ ed for a year ago , which helped to go to the operation .
when the emphasis on the p@@ hil@@ os@@ op@@ her fell , he became an appropriate candidate for transplantation .
the plant operation is not considered a very difficult section , according to the T@@ im@@ k : it is very important that the right timing is very important .
it was a lot more to get the gri@@ p , and then get up to heart if a new heart is put in &apos; it was spoken .
in addition , the car@@ di@@ a@@ sur@@ sur@@ sur@@ ge of the operation ex@@ pelled from the blood of blood , as a complicated part of the operation .
rather , he says that it can be considered a bran@@ ch , as he says it is the least in need of it .
much more is being done about kid@@ ne@@ y , li@@ ver and l@@ ung transplants .
it is still an ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation with the rare section , but for many years we have been ac@@ custom@@ ed to this work for many years .
learning myself and my ner@@ v@@ ous system is one of the art of this office &apos; , including Thailand .
there are four more people in need of this body .
it was said that you had the heart of the patient because none of the other patients who live in the S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ n@@ ant in the Community of S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ u .
the S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ation is an organisation of the organisation of the organisation of the organisation of the organisation of organs , of which there are members of Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Sweden and Estonia .
there are four more people on the voting list in Estonia .
&apos;@@ they are , after all , un@@ authorised patients &apos; , stressed the P@@ le@@ der .
for the rest , the T@@ im says that it is the fo@@ d@@ der to a positive ha@@ ke of water , large men .
&apos;@@ L@@ o in Finland has been around half a year &apos; , said it .
there are also a share of the conditions to get a heart .

the comparison of S@@ p@@ ul@@ ner@@ e packages : a comparison of the Ecolabel tic@@ kets from the Ecolabel tic@@ kets from the Ecolabel tic@@ kets .
the consumer performance of the Hungarian plant was compared with the more favourable packages offered by the slu@@ ms for one night from 1@@ 1-@@ 12 August .
&apos;@@ S@@ pa@@ a@@ ho@@ tels have a different level and service choice , so one of the comparison of the price is very difficult to do so &apos; , the comm@@ and man@@ ager of the S@@ o T@@ our@@ t , the head of sale of S@@ tan@@ t S@@ pa T@@ our@@ t .
it turns out that , compared with the possibilities for accommodation , it turns out that the cost of the most favourable packages is several times , and the options are to be found for a more demanding custom@@ er , as well as more modest ones .
for example , if a passenger alone for the passenger , for EUR 51 , in the V@@ ene@@ us S@@ pa D@@ al in the V@@ el@@ ine S@@ pa Un@@ it in the V@@ el@@ ine S@@ pa , the house of bu@@ ff@@ er and the un@@ restra@@ ined use of the islands , then while those who visit a passenger &apos;s head to the bottom of the package , the price of a single person will be subject to a price of EUR 2@@ 87 per person .
it contains the accommodation of D@@ ou@@ b@@ le D@@ esi@@ x@@ e in the category of D@@ ou@@ ble , a break@@ fast from the resta@@ ur@@ ant , the resta@@ ur@@ ant of the resta@@ ur@@ ant , as well as the &apos; semi@@ -@@ old &apos; package .
in the gu@@ ise and comparison with different packages , consideration should be given to the fact that , in order to obtain the most favourable prices , holiday should go with a friend or with com@@ po@@ sure , because two do@@ zen do@@ w@@ ns must be made more favourable than just a few .
however , if there is a desire alone , it will be offered to a visitors in this case , as well as in the case of a special , in accordance with the special one-@@ figure rooms , as well as for the additional fee .
if , in general , the passenger who has to be paid is simply to pay a few tens of euros per premi@@ um alone , then by making compromises , it is also possible to find more favourable options .
for example , the F@@ R@@ A T@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ as , the F@@ R@@ A T@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ as , the package will cost EUR 86 at night by night , but , if you wish , there will also be a more favourable option in the dual do@@ zen , provided that , in the event of a spa@@ tial shortage , no one will be accommo@@ dated .
in this case , the package will have to be assessed at EUR 58 .
it is worth being flexible in order to get a positive line .
the prices of packages are dynamic , in other words , depend on the last day and the up@@ take of the week .
in the case of the most favourable package , prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 &apos; , the T@@ hal@@ k V@@ el of S@@ pa@@ a@@ po@@ tel@@ li , who was based on T@@ in@@ k , explained their price policy .
he also drew attention to the fact that in these ho@@ tels , the price is changing , depending on the up@@ take , and added that , in general , the custom@@ er can obtain a favourable price , boo@@ king directly their home le@@ ts or ask myself .
as the summer period is most rapid , it is worth planning a holiday in good time in order to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold .
for example , in the case of the comparison of packages , both in the P@@ ä@@ r@@ t , as well as S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa and conference ho@@ tel only only s@@ ci@@ tes , as well as the sale of the Gulf of Vi@@ he@@ des has been sold .
the opportunities to spend loo@@ se leave do not have to go a long way : almost every major city of Estonia will find one or even many s@@ lip@@ s .
however , it is worth examining a few major events before purchasing the package , and at the same time , there are no major events in the vic@@ in@@ ity , because it puts prices straight away .
for example , from 11 to 13 August , there are the events of the White J@@ am@@ i , for example .
at the time , there is a lot of tourists in Haiti , demand for accommodation sites is very high and we have the prices of major events at that time .
&apos;@@ so , at that time , we have no accommodation at a preferential rate or a favourable packages &apos; , commen@@ ted on the ma@@ gic ho@@ tel , President I@@ ren@@ e .

why are airlines going on the air ?
the example of the left is that , if a plane is on a huge scale , the air , with a different speed , a different speed with the difference between the facts of the spo@@ ts , at one point , it exceeds the aircraft in the air and it is pushing the air in the air .
the same process is actually taking place in water .
this is the right way to take the right track , it is an increase which , as a matter of fact , is creating an increase in a &apos; over@@ arching &apos; basis .
a simple thing ?
it is difficult to come to the figures .
a plane needs a minimum of 15@@ 0-@@ kilometre hours per hour to rise , a piece of between 150 and 250 per hour , a world record of sa@@ il@@ ants is now &apos; no &apos; at 12@@ 1.@@ 1 km / h .
however , let us not bo@@ w secondary school into physical school !
today I have taken a look at the &apos; s@@ lee@@ ping &apos; Catal@@ an which bears the name of the NA@@ C@@ R@@ A@@ F@@ 20 Car@@ bon F@@ on .

this is a system that allows the team to set the foundations in the middle of &apos; flight &apos; , and 20 out of the d@@ run@@ k in the j@@ ung@@ le .
as soon as the Catal@@ an has been released , it is clear that this is not a gentle@@ man &apos;s P@@ y@@ m@@ ä@@ r@@ ti@@ o .

&apos;@@ T@@ o beyond the d@@ ash ? &apos; I really do not understand .
&apos;@@ No , no , the entire sin &apos; , is a brief answer .
170 kil@@ os - our three of us who are going on , are certainly going on , we will certainly consider more than 170 kil@@ os .

Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alexander and his life , the home home of L@@ oo@@ k , which is at least half a million in A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an home ; / B@@ la@@ ke S@@ to@@ re@@ y , Pri@@ e C@@ rea@@ t@@ ve Me@@ dia .
in the autumn of this year , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , marks its 7@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
his father was a national official and M@@ ary lo@@ ved the food of his mother .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e learned a libr@@ ary at universities and , as the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an young people went custom@@ ary , he went after study to Europe after study .
in France , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , travelling by Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , is only an ob@@ session and developed .
in London , however , he met his first spo@@ use , the J@@ ama@@ ica roots , with the roots of J@@ ama@@ ica , with the roots of J@@ am@@ ica , with whom they went back to Australia in 196@@ 4 .
a ten years later the marriage broke down and the resta@@ ur@@ ant closed the doors .
in 197@@ 6 , he has already opened up to a resta@@ ur@@ ant of Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , a resta@@ ur@@ ant of Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , which was one of the most 21 years on the table .
resta@@ ur@@ ants are still being talked about as the first F@@ ine d@@ in in the place of the F@@ ine d@@ in , where there was a F@@ ine d@@ in , which really did not value the value of fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be an a@@ ab@@ y@@ it@@ r truth , but at no one at all at the end of the last century .
following a re@@ treat from the resta@@ ur@@ ant in 1997 , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e has been concentrated on the writing of the ch@@ am@@ bers , 15 of his closure .
in Estonia , there are productivity signatories , but in his case no one of the books has simply been a prescription .
in Australia &apos;s home ch@@ emis@@ try , Mr Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e A@@ p@@ han@@ e A@@ le@@ an@@ i@@ e has been irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
in my life , however , the fifth c@@ oo@@ ki@@ es , the su@@ preme C@@ oo@@ k &apos; The C@@ oo@@ k - The C@@ oo@@ k - The C@@ oo@@ k - The C@@ oo@@ k - &apos; L@@ y &apos;s compli@@ ant &apos; ) , which is now at least half a million in Australia &apos;s home .
the book was in 1996 , for the first time in 1996 , an improved publication in 2004 and the latest version in 2014 .
in my libr@@ ary , that is exactly what it is going to do in 2004 , because , in the j@@ our@@ nal book , about a thousand of the reci@@ pe for 1@@ 12@@ 6 pages .
the latest option , however , is even more extensive .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ e A@@ le@@ an@@ er A@@ le@@ an@@ er : &apos; the C@@ oo@@ k , &apos; Com@@ pan@@ i@@ on &apos; - is at least half a million in Australia &apos;s home .
it is a true co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il Bi@@ ble , where , as well as the purchase and storage of various raw materials , the technologies for making food are being introduced and making recommendations for the purchase of vegetables water .
food is in a sta@@ mp order , as well as a number of cross-@@ references - obviously no libr@@ ary education does not go beyond the aspects of the libr@@ ary education .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e emphasises that it was this book that changed his life and gave a new direction to the future .
as a result of its popul@@ arity , the feeling that it has something to give people , five to the design of the next great , pi@@ g , which , under our circumstances , are comparable with school@@ ing .
R@@ AS@@ M@@ US M@@ ä@@ g : preparation has not gone as though I saw in my mind .
it is not all the things that have been the case , as I did in mind &apos; , spoke about the training that prece@@ ded M@@ our M@@ M .
on the final Saturday , there are important points that show how the body is exactly .
and the competition will show that anyway , what we are analysing here .
on this day , I believe that my preparation has been of a high quality , both this year and in previous years , and so on all this , it is possible to run normally .
with something special , the pre@@ mise of the time 13@@ .@@ 05 , according to the time of Estonia , has not yet been dealt with in the past , after the home Ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ships .
in recent weeks , we often have a lot of tra@@ in@@ e@@ es@@ hi@@ ps .
in V@@ er@@ s@@ where , I should and could be very useful that the last M@@ M@@ S week was a little bit easier .
the coming days are going on to physical physi@@ ci@@ ans : yesterday , the barrier to a war@@ mer trend today is doing a war@@ mer trend .
in his mental preparation , however , he does not want to be very ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant : &apos; I have had a long rou@@ tine of our own rou@@ tine .
there is a lot of silence and peace , and some rou@@ tine music will not let their own deser@@ ts .
I do not need to look at some of the motiva@@ ting vi@@ de@@ os or to read the teaching books , but to be present here and at this moment to assess the possibility that a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have come together in order to compare their abilities at one location .
this , in itself , is creating a distinction .
the m@@ ood is , of course , for every a@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the year , and , in that case , each of the previous launch has also been taken in the T@@ au@@ an@@ t@@ all , has also taken a test - an attempt to have been compared with some of the con@@ tro@@ ver@@ si@@ es .
there will no longer be any chance to experim@@ ental competition .
&apos;@@ The aim here is simply to run quickly &apos; , talks about &apos; , but adds that , if a pre-@@ drin@@ k and a potentially semi@@ -@@ final , will be able to make even a percentage or a couple of energy , they will certainly help with the next drin@@ k .
for the first time , the Middle East is going to the election of a party leader and an ideological foundation .
so far , we said in the Middle East and we have said the Sa@@ throw , or vice vers@@ a .
it is now up to the Middle East to find the way .
in doing so , they also need to ru@@ in the pa@@ tho@@ gen@@ s , at times from criminal and embarras@@ sing past , S@@ P@@ lu@@ m@@ is &apos;s party supporters and expectations of the electorate .
the dis@@ signa@@ tion of Sa@@ telli@@ is is in the most difficult situation of the centre in ideological terms .
on the basis of political practice and ideology to date , it can be said that it is playing the old n@@ in@@ as@@ ka@@ vi@@ k .
a number of cards , which previously affects the effects as instruments , may not materi@@ alise this time .
P@@ op@@ ul@@ is@@ m@@ ä@@ ard is not working for the centre , because Sa@@ and@@ ar can always be allowed more than the Prime Minister &apos;s party .
the Russian card is being b@@ reached on the Russian card , both in terms of the government &apos;s position , but also because here , too , we can see how the so-called Sa@@ v@@ o@@ va electoral union is sin@@ king down the gas .
the victim &apos;s card is already in the pockets of Sa@@ telli@@ te as a result of the ongoing judicial process .
for the centre , an offensive of an offensive of the R@@ ah@@ v@@ ine and the poor , has also disappeared .
the first of these is its un@@ valuable and the other more intensive is blocking the coalition partner in the government .
however , one card may be even more important .
all the last elections have confirmed that it is the parties that are able to formulate the main electoral f@@ esti@@ val and then put it into practice .
the sub@@ ju@@ gation of the main elements of the sub@@ ju@@ gation of S@@ po@@ t@@ g@@ is .
if some parties should be able to brea@@ the life into a well-@@ functioning opposition to life is once again one of the tru@@ mp@@ s of the C@@ ris@@ is has yet to be found .
what , then , will you be in the Middle East ?
a strong party appar@@ atus and a significant resource are there .
we must also have enough room in the run-up to the elections .
the stig@@ mat@@ isation of self-@@ advertise@@ ment with taxpayers &apos; money has now , hopefully , been re@@ paid out by the majority of the taxpayers &apos; money .
in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , there is only yet , but the cultivation of a party &apos;s private gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ as has been left there .
in addition , the party has a vo@@ id of vote .
their role will be to be brought out this time , because the image of a power party is not enough to moti@@ vate the electorate in a meaningful way .
in an ideological context , Mr Ra@@ ta@@ s must find its way , because the journey ended with the sa@@ ve po@@ ll in this week .
the tal@@ ent in P@@ tou@@ te We@@ e@@ il : d@@ run@@ ken man on a foreign car to go to a foreign car .

the most stu@@ p@@ id questions to be put to the ba@@ r .
from Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ s , the ba@@ r Po@@ st is going to get out the ba@@ r &apos;s e@@ ars that they do not want to hear .
what drin@@ k best you can do ?
in some drin@@ ks , there are indeed more ingredients than the other , but they require the same skills and skills to prepare them .
they often interpret this matter as &apos; W@@ hat is the e@@ asi@@ est / speed at the moment ? &apos; , which gives them an indication that the custom@@ er does not know what he or she drin@@ ks to make it a ba@@ r difficult or not .
what sort of drin@@ k is you most keen to close ?
this question is being interpreted in the same way that what kind of do@@ g would be the best way out of the ba@@ r at the moment .
it is not the case to say that , but it is the custom@@ er who makes decisions on the basis of their w@@ alle@@ ts .
rather , the basic elements would be waiting for the question of whether there are any specific offers at present .
what is a good offer here ?
perhaps there is a genuine desire to know whether the ba@@ r is priva@@ tised with any offers from others , but it could also be asked otherwise .
nor can ba@@ r out what the custom@@ er could even give priority to .
could I get a drin@@ k that would not be a very tas@@ te ?
here , like the previous rule , the ba@@ r &apos;s tas@@ te is not aware of the tas@@ tes and the preferences that I am thinking of , and which is in one respect , may not be for the others .
however , it is ready to listen to what ma@@ gic desirable co@@ ws might be included .
does this drin@@ k gives me a hea@@ da@@ che / po@@ p ?
in the face of B@@ ap@@ se , there is no media or a forecast to know that the custom@@ er is to be told the custom@@ er .
the police are se@@ arching for the head map of Estonia .

the Belgian authorities were already aware of the arrival of eggs in June in June .
&apos;@@ L@@ et us have known at the beginning of June possible problems with a fi@@ d-@@ train &apos; , the Belgian spokes@@ man , K@@ at@@ ri@@ en S@@ tra@@ gi@@ er , who is responsible for food security in Belgium , Mr S@@ tra@@ gi@@ er , who is responsible for food security .
we started an investigation without delay and we have also talked about the Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s Office , because it could be fraud .
it then became a secret of the inquiry .
we understand that people have health issues and we are trying to respond to them &apos; , in the anne@@ x of Sta@@ gi@@ er .
the news agency A@@ F@@ P attempted in recent days to receive information from the prosecu@@ tors in recent days , but it did not talk about anything , because an investi@@ ga@@ tive ref@@ e@@ re@@ e has refused information .
the C@@ an@@ am@@ ens have been removed as a precautionary measure as a precautionary measure until the results of the analyses are clear .
in the Netherlands and Germany , millions of Dutch eggs have been removed .
the German Minister for Agriculture , Chris@@ ti@@ an Schmidt , has invited the Dutch and Belgian authorities to clarify the matter quickly .
&apos;@@ W@@ ho has obviously pollu@@ ted eggs in a criminal manner with banned products that were banned in a criminal manner &apos; , told Schmidt to the German newspaper , Bil@@ d .
according to data from the Est@@ onian Ar@@ ch@@ and Food Authority ( V@@ TA ) , according to the data on the Netherlands , that has been produced from pesticides produced in the Netherlands .
&apos;@@ The Dutch mon@@ e@@ y in Estonia , according to our data , the Dutch spokes@@ man , Martin Al@@ wi@@ and B@@ N@@ S .
he added that there are also other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia .
according to the statistical office , over the past 10 years , the Netherlands has not been imported from the Netherlands over the last 10 years .
most recently , in Estonia , they were the Netherlands in 2006 .
the Dutch authorities are sus@@ pi@@ cious that pesticides on the p@@ hil@@ l ended up in the chic@@ ken by the Dutch company Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ m following an attempt to cure their treatment .
the reports of the Dutch and Belgian media that the body containing pesticides has yet to be confirmed by Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ n through a Belgian company has yet to be confirmed .

how can we stop being affected when you are trying to get a child ?
therefore , it is very important to stop the stone bu@@ b@@ ble even when you are trying to create a new life .
Mr F@@ ir@@ st gives advice how to do so in such a way that it does not seem to be a kind of commitment .
do not take this as an obligation to do so .
this could happen to any couples who is trying to contra@@ dict pregnancy .
sometimes contra@@ ception could take years for years .
it takes on the co@@ ff@@ in of orders , the spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous and ro@@ man@@ tic .

women often feel that it is not possible to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end the &apos; ordinary &apos; sex at the end of the cycle , when it is known that there will be no positive outcome .
it is causing tensions , which , in turn , lead to a reduction in the sex , and less of it means , of course , the possibility of contra@@ ception .
the men feel , however , that they must be able to &apos; take &apos; , if they are required to do so .
if you know your fer@@ tile days , it can be on your side &apos;s side in order to plan any more expensive ro@@ man@@ tic .
be it a special din@@ ner for this , or just to spend time - enjoy one another !
this fruitful period will be taken into account .
from the point of view of a lot , there is no point if the the@@ at@@ ric@@ ation has taken place , but in order for you to see a few of you in the days of non-@@ fer@@ tile days .
while there is no evidence that contra@@ ception would be more robust , and the woman &apos;s or@@ ch@@ as@@ m can , however , forget that .
I am almost aware that every couple of people are different .
everyone can do so differently with the b@@ et of b@@ el@@ t .
some men want to know a woman &apos;s cycle and others prefer not to know that they do not feel the pressure to take &apos; to demand &apos; .
no one will know the other yourself better , how best best su@@ its you .
find your solution !
studies have shown that a higher degree of success is in the couples who are involved every few days , but not every one or two are unable to keep such den@@ sity .
the most important thing is to find a pat@@ tern that best su@@ its you for a few .
10 under@@ ground advertising labelling , with which the appearance of food makes the appearance of the appearance of food .
because a lot of foods are hard to photo@@ g@@ rap@@ hed , the picture will be used in a completely different ingredi@@ ent that def@@ ends people - for example , a chic@@ ken instead of milk , instead of a li@@ m@@ b instead of ice .
the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be he@@ el on the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , makes an overview of which tri@@ cks are quite common in the advertising world .
if someone is opening up a po@@ p in a po@@ p , or it is taking away a few of it out of it , a number of a few a@@ ur@@ ts are thrown out of it .
in reality , you are going to take a longer and , throughout this period , the food is not a@@ ur@@ sed , because the honourable is coming from a high water content which is not , for example , in the case of products .
that is why there is a package or a cotton lea@@ gue found in the water sp@@ il@@ led by food , which will be able to absor@@ b and maintain their water in the water .
in close proximity to this heat , they will be rewar@@ ding much longer than Mr Bur@@ ger or bo@@ y , and the product has come from fresh ground .
the Car@@ tu@@ i@@ der is a great ab@@ y@@ ss , because it will not be mel@@ ting or heat in the hands of light or heat , nor does it make a significant difference in the context of the context of a number of other food .
for example , a school may be with a po@@ et instead of the example of ice ice , or the po@@ ta@@ to of ice ice , instead of the example of ice ice ice .
the bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re col@@ ours and dis@@ co@@ medi@@ atory elements , and the consumer has once again been bu@@ ried .
the Li@@ im is replacing milk .
it is not easy to look at milk , because it might not be so kind out of it at all .
foodstuffs on milk also quickly become l@@ y@@ n@@ ights within it as a matter of urgency .
because , for example , the morning &apos;s or m@@ ole@@ w@@ l , for example , milk has to be seen in C@@ ap@@ ts and car@@ ro@@ ts , which is not going through any b@@ reat@@ h .
when resta@@ ur@@ ants can make a great deal of effort to make meat preparation so that the result is me@@ an@@ ine and stu@@ p@@ id right , then in advertise@@ ments .
however , the meat that has been presented in advertising is particularly attractive , as has come directly from g@@ ri@@ l@@ la .
often , however , it is prepared for s@@ na@@ p@@ ts or gre@@ ed , and pul@@ ling the meat g@@ ri@@ x@@ on with a gi@@ ant .
it is just as difficult to work with the ice content , because it ten@@ ds to mel@@ ting .
fortunately , there is a product that is ou@@ t-@@ of-@@ touch almost identical to the appearance - the ha@@ be@@ ac@@ y@@ man@@ ship .
it may , therefore , be on advertising , or on mar@@ ches , or within milk co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il .
even on the surface of the school fruit sold in the shops may be an a@@ x@@ e la@@ yer , which makes their appearance very remote .
for the fo@@ d@@ der , however , it is not enough , and the threshold for fruit is being s@@ pra@@ yed to the de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
yes , however , it is not just the fo@@ to@@ genic , because they are going to get liqu@@ ids or , for example , dis@@ pen@@ se with water .
here , however , it is coming to the aid of a kind of priva@@ tely col@@ oured col@@ ours and a more permanent practice will make it possible to make an attractive father .
these images are likely to be used as well , where ne@@ ak@@ y cho@@ col@@ ate is flow@@ ing on a school or on ice .
when no@@ tori@@ ous advertise@@ ments have been adver@@ tised with an ideal cross-@@ section where the relationship between the b@@ is@@ k@@ en@@ s and do@@ w@@ ns is perfect , there have apparently been some additional la@@ yer or bul@@ lying .
this is because you can break out of school in the ca@@ talo@@ gue may be dis@@ per@@ sed , and the picture could be b@@ reached .
once a paragraph has been cut , it would like to give a do@@ zen of the impression and s@@ pra@@ ying them with a supplementary , it leaves a vis@@ ual example of a lot .
a car@@ t and a k@@ it@@ che@@ n will also be used within the bur@@ g@@ ger , so that all the ingredients there are in place , so that they are in a beautiful position .
that is why we are not going to see like advertising on the table .
I have the paper as an ad@@ ri@@ ft chic@@ ken .
in advertising the gre@@ ed can see a me@@ al out of the g@@ las@@ ses , but it may not even be prepared to mature .
to get the impression of today , the chic@@ ken is being put on the chic@@ ken by the chic@@ ken , if necessary , with the po@@ ta@@ to of po@@ ta@@ to@@ es , and then the chic@@ ken is simply being s@@ pra@@ yed on the colour of the bro@@ wn .
it is particularly the case in American advertise@@ ments that are we@@ a@@ ther@@ ing , particularly in American advertise@@ ments , because this picture is creating a big appe@@ tite for people .
in fact , the code per@@ me@@ ates a transplant quickly in the past , and with a flow of sinc@@ er@@ ity , photo@@ graph@@ s will quickly disappear from the fast track .
every gan@@ g is therefore being s@@ pra@@ yed by every car@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture clean@@ ing tool , which will help to avoid any rapid im@@ pul@@ se .
often , too , this aid is not the case , and so it is being taken to help the engine oil that is being put on the table of g@@ end@@ ants , and it is being presented as a transplant .
in the Est@@ 18 of Estonia , the Polish good and the A@@ -@@ diplom@@ as were not won by the UK .
the match started extremely quickly and the first quarter of a quarter of five points ( 18 : 23 ) won a great deal of re@@ tic@@ ence .
the second quarter increased the difference even further and , in the n@@ in@@ th anniversary of the re@@ signa@@ tion of the visitors ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia was able to win the third quarter , but only one point .

the leaders of the distri@@ cts of the region of Estonia have made an appeal to the public and political parties , calling for voting on the centre and not by the electoral unions .

in response to An@@ si@@ za : we have done a great deal for the success of Estonia .
the Vice-President of the European Commission , And@@ r@@ us An@@ si@@ p , said in an inter@@ view to K@@ u@@ on@@ ik@@ i , that he was sad to look at the Est@@ onian &apos;s daily policy , because the J@@ ü@@ r@@ r@@ i Ra@@ level Government has taken on its head of a simple and predictable tax system .
I was using the chronic opportunity to ask me that what I have done for the success of Estonia and on which I can be proud of .
I am glad that we are a good team in the government and , in the months I have read , many important decisions , many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years &apos; , has been written in the social media today .
according to the level , these decisions are , for example , a tax reform to raise people &apos;s incomes , a pension reform to ensure a decent retirement age for elderly people , a government reform to balance the development of Estonia , a increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and , of course , health reform for providing access to accessible and high quality care .

it is worth knowing how to calcu@@ late how much sugar is sugar in milk production ?
according to the European Union &apos;s food labelling standards , the packaging can be developed on the packaging to the quantity of hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons and the quantity of sugar , which does not equ@@ ate to the collection of the &apos; des@@ pi@@ l collection &apos; , the V@@ ali@@ o marketing director K@@ ris@@ ta Kal@@ m@@ in can be set out on the packaging .
he says that in dairy products , there are three types of sugar in dairy products : the la@@ h in milk , that is , a la@@ c@@ on , a la@@ g of milk , the g@@ l@@ t@@ se of fruit , as well as a ratio added to the sugar , or suc@@ rose .
however , if you remember a few simple basic messages , then we should not have to calcu@@ late the accompanying quantities of sugar contained in the product , should not be borne in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy .
first of all , it must be made clear whether it is a case of milk or o@@ ste@@ red milk products .
in the normal milk and milk rush , around 5 g a modi@@ cu@@ m of a piece of milk , that is to say the end of 100 grams per product .
in the case of healthy dairy milk products , yo@@ gu@@ r@@ tic or bo@@ y bac@@ teri@@ a in the o@@ pi@@ um process have ce@@ ased to take part in the o@@ x@@ y@@ um process , which is why , on average , there has been an average of 3.@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g of a product .
in order to calcu@@ late the quantities of sugar included , the first is to calcu@@ late the total amount of sugar at the end &apos; , in the words of Kal@@ b@@ in .
now you have to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar in the pi@@ g and fer@@ tile f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and g@@ lu@@ e from fer@@ tile .
&apos;@@ generally , in ph@@ lam@@ s and g@@ l@@ g@@ ag@@ s , in the case of f@@ lor@@ ky and g@@ l@@ g@@ ag@@ s , respectively , 0.@@ 3 grams and , in particular , in br@@ and@@ s , 15 % of fruit products in crops with the fru@@ its of up to 1.5 g 100 grams , were said in Kal@@ by .
according to him , this simple calculation shows that the proportion of su@@ g@@ aring may be up to two times less than the proportion of sugar that is indicated on the packaging .
the situation is slightly different in the case of non-@@ lo@@ c@@ table products , because it is up to them to depend on production technology .
a 10@@ 1 year-old man ju@@ mped from a plane .
in the wake of the Second World War , H@@ in@@ n Ha@@ y@@ n has recently received a military prize to celebrate a sha@@ m ac@@ id which broke his world record .
it was the man who made the age for the age of 10@@ 1 years and 38 days , thus sending the older em@@ it@@ ters committed someone in the world .
in antici@@ pation of the final air emissions : is Mr K@@ an@@ ter is doing the M@@ M@@ P &apos;s history ?
the current m@@ ood is eigh@@ th for K@@ an@@ ter , none of his competi@@ tor in London .
in addition , the only thing is the only he@@ re@@ mon@@ ial through a history that has won the full package of med@@ als ( gold , two sil@@ ver and two p@@ ron@@ x ) M@@ ali .

if the governing world is to cast itself a double world champi@@ ons , he will be the older he@@ in@@ ers , who is the M@@ M@@ P won the gol@@ den me@@ tre .
the same option is the Polish Chan@@ nel P@@ j@@ ot@@ on Mal@@ ac@@ ho@@ w@@ ski@@ l ( the age of 34 and 60 days old ) .
just an exc@@ iting facts :
more than one occasion , the a@@ th@@ le@@ tes of just two countries have come to the fore .
in Germany , we have nine gol@@ den med@@ als in Germany .
the World C@@ up record belongs to the name of Mr A@@ le@@ ana , which is in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , which is in Hel@@ sin@@ ki ( in 2005 ) of 7@@ 0@@ 17 .
the lowest result , which has been won by the w@@ ings , is 6@@ 6.@@ 20 - it began in R@@ ies ( 199@@ 1 ) .
why are the do@@ gs es@@ p@@ ou@@ sed in ?
sometimes it is thought that the do@@ g is eating a lot , if he does not know myself well and wants to ste@@ er himself .
in fact , the vast majority of the gras@@ s are completely healthy .
just under 10 per cent of the do@@ gs who seem to be able to do so by a few diseases .
one of the reasons why the do@@ g can suddenly start to eat , may be nutri@@ ent food that is nutri@@ ent .
those do@@ gs , who have religions , can take greater interest in the face of the face .
therefore , when a do@@ g , who has not gone on a b@@ el@@ t in the past , he is often ea@@ ten to eat it , it is worth going to check the doctor in order , for example , to quickly get to gri@@ ps with a potential ra@@ ison d &apos;@@ ê@@ tre .
it is worth mentioning that the do@@ g may also be a sha@@ m because he likes this tas@@ te or is simply b@@ oring .
when the health problem is excluded , it would be worth as@@ cer@@ tain@@ ing that a family &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite is still being sufficiently developed and present .
five more than 200 people were transferred by the police at the time of the We@@ e@@ k@@ s were over 200 people
a total of more than 20 crimes were recorded in the days of f@@ esti@@ val in the town of B@@ esti@@ val .
there is a reason to link around half of them , apart from the use of violence , a large amount of nar@@ co@@ tic substance and two drin@@ k-@@ driving .
the mis@@ appropri@@ ation initiated by the Sa@@ da@@ r were mainly related to the use or possession of alcohol supply or the use of banned substances .
a the@@ ft and a breach of public order were received .
for various reasons , the police station has led to more than 200 people for a variety of reasons .
approximately half a hundred were minors , and largely the reason for their delivery on the part of the police station .
there were more minors in ja@@ il who have been given the soil .
one hundred and a half hundred people were , perhaps , as much as they did last year .
in view of the expectations of the above figures , Mr S@@ human , the head of the police office , there is a large crow@@ d of the aforementioned figures , given the expectations of the abo@@ v@@ em@@ en@@ tioned figures .

&apos;@@ This is an extremely slowly mobile storm &apos; , added to him , noting that there is therefore a bigger flood risk because , in one area , there is plenty of rain in a given area .

the debate was addressed to the population , such as the development of ship and airlines between small islands and the continent .
the country has made a commitment to ensure regular transport links with the small islands , but , for example , increasing traffic during the summer period , for example , will make the important vehicles of local residents more difficult .
these are places where the country can already take account of local wishes and needs in an early and planning process &apos; , the Prime Minister , to take account of local wishes and needs .

&apos;@@ because F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k is found and se@@ arching for various things , I first thought to try there &apos; , the Car@@ in , whose post has been distributed by almost 4 000 people .
&apos;@@ Po@@ int has received any feedback , and not everything is a good thing , a woman , referring to the first comments to be made to his own man .
then , while the feeling was that this was what was needed now .
that my man has become the greatest dece@@ it of whom we have heard .
to be honest , it did at the beginning of what was concerned , but afterwards , when the comments were made that I , myself , have suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ ing to the ow@@ ner of the da@@ r .
the general experts also suggested that suddenly the po@@ cket has reached the second round of ri@@ f@@ ts to the Naz@@ is .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , last somewhere six months ago , one of the other people purchased to go to work , which s@@ pr@@ ung up without a more in-depth study into the was@@ hing machine , but is it really ? &apos; we are discussing a woman .
be that as it may , but with life partners , we have agreed that we would now have to find a w@@ in-@@ win .
whatever the cause of this re@@ signa@@ tion is whatever it may be .
divorce , family quar@@ rel or whatever .
I think that is only the right thing to do , because I know that I would be very grateful to a person who would try and return me a valuable asset .
Kar@@ in has also turned to the civil situation in order to get a helping hand there .
however , I received an answer that in Estonia on that date and that is what Mr mar@@ ried by the name .
one of the words is that of the ow@@ ner .
recently , in T@@ all@@ in@@ n P@@ el@@ u@@ m@@ be@@ n , on 21 July in T@@ all@@ in@@ da P@@ el@@ u@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ a , the gra@@ pe of a gra@@ pe which was promised to suggest that it belongs to an elderly woman .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ d@@ n@@ led with do@@ gs in the morning , and I noticed the 53 house that is behind 53 house , in@@ ta@@ ct ra@@ ined , gol@@ den war &apos; , says a Ger@@ l that a gra@@ b would suggest it belongs to a woman .
in writing . - ( NL ) In his F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , a F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k lea@@ k and a group &apos; noted &apos; in T@@ all@@ in@@ n &apos; , that information with the May@@ or of North T@@ all@@ in@@ na .
in two weeks &apos; time , the police have been in contact with for@@ k and announced that the S@@ k@@ ir@@ ment has been identified .
&apos;@@ I was in contact with the ow@@ ner &apos;s da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter and on Monday evening the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter went to the gu@@ ise &apos; ; S@@ hel@@ m had gone , because the old A@@ mb@@ assador had been w@@ o@@ ven up with the other , where it was sli@@ pped down .
&apos;@@ he lost it on the same day morning , when my do@@ g was wal@@ king &apos; , says Ger@@ l .
from time to time , we still have to go to the forest , for whatever reason .
however , if you bo@@ w to the baby , however , it is the right time to make a single hot road .
there are sufficient resources to do so in the forest .
there is a small view of the protection of the home .
on the other hand , we are talking about a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , which is , to some extent , a virtual one , but it is not the best for our health .
using the plants found in the open nature , it is always necessary to be ready to test , because both prescri@@ ptions and tas@@ tes are different .
some of them do not need a long time , only hot water ri@@ gging , but others have to be abandoned for hours .
of course , it must also be atten@@ tive that water and plants are sufficiently clean .
a lot of the time and place will also be dependent on the time and place .
we are now going to see how to prepare a few simple ways and what influence they can have on us .
M@@ en@@ ni@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ r@@ d
a wave of che@@ ese can be a peaceful year in July .
if a day is a good way to drin@@ k 2 lit@@ res of water a day , it is well worth meeting the C@@ -@@ vita@@ min@@ in need and , moreover , provide a little extra energy .
as with all plants , it is possible to get useful elements from the games of the game by using alternative methods , for example by w@@ rec@@ ting - s@@ co@@ res - for a long time , a hot water &apos;s over@@ la@@ yer and a little bit of de@@ preci@@ ation .
half a li@@ tre of water takes 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res , which have to be listed for 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k in which nearly 25 m@@ g C has a ca@@ th@@ in , a lot of c@@ abin@@ et and c@@ in@@ k .
in addition , the drin@@ k contains around 1.5 sugar heat , that is to say , 20 k@@ ca sugar .
in order to improve the tas@@ te , there can always be coherence and honey in order to improve the tas@@ te .
and when a drin@@ k got into the Chamber , it can d@@ il@@ u@@ te it like a transplant .
preparing the road to the road to Cuba is in the same way , but the drin@@ k is something that de@@ served a little bit differently .
the V@@ ar@@ ik@@ i@@ oo@@ k is excellent and is contributing to a very large number of w@@ ounds , a trau@@ ma .
the V@@ ar@@ ch will help to overcome ti@@ re@@ dness , is an act that is pain@@ ting out , and it will help in the event of crop diseases , both as a relief allevi@@ ator , as well as the fel@@ ling of the fe@@ ver .
consequently , it would not be worth over half a a day a day .
the V@@ ar@@ ik@@ i@@ oo@@ k is also dra@@ gging , which is why a more peaceful moment should be found in winter .
to make a drin@@ k in winter , fresh bo@@ ys , the equ@@ als or bra@@ ins are taking advantage of the ba@@ g , the equivalent or the mark .
for half a li@@ tre of drin@@ k is needed for the drin@@ k &apos;s drin@@ k , which must be fed up as long as water ac@@ qui@@ res a red tone .
it can also be drawn from the V@@ ar@@ id Islands .
to this end , the the@@ ft and ho@@ sting them in a warm water for a few hours .
a longer and more thorough process of unemployment will also be made .
a super@@ flu@@ ous wait can be included on the s@@ lip@@ per@@ y rush as well .
a f@@ las@@ h s@@ tun@@ n tra@@ jec@@ tion
the f@@ ham@@ mer is a c@@ ry that looks like a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ et piece in the villa@@ ge of a me@@ k .
most of all , it is found in the ca@@ kes , but also elsewhere .
Se@@ on is a very broad one - a hot drin@@ k , to har@@ vest fire , rather than the virus and so on .
ash is also very well was@@ hed .
a sort of super@@ -@@ cycle is a kind of super@@ cycle that can be used for a whole range of diseases , even cancer , or len@@ i@@ ent , to increase the tone , to increase stress , reduce stress , extending life expectancy .
it contains a series of unique comp@@ ounds and a lot of B@@ -@@ vita@@ mi@@ es , as well as anti@@ business and a few min@@ er@@ als and protein .
the path made by the Se@@ en@@ is may , on a daily basis , do not pose a risk of over@@ consumption .
to do drin@@ k , approximately 3 x 3 c@@ m will be enough to do so , which will have to be 5 to 15 minutes of five to 15 lit@@ res in water .
a woman wal@@ ks around the globe : my current budget is USD 5 !
in fact , I have had such experience , and it is true that 40 days , where I decided in southern France to live a life , simply to be free and to live day on the same day .
it was surroun@@ ded by an a@@ x@@ is , the forest , the small town stations , etc .
on the second week I joined one of the French &apos; homes &apos; , 44 years old man had ...
Mr O@@ i , do not think that some of the pe@@ de@@ ten@@ tions v@@ ines : I was the same par@@ k in M@@ en@@ ton and we became friends , although she was 15@@ a parent , was a good com@@ motion .
it came out that a man has been good family , Par@@ is@@ ism , a former French na@@ vy officer .
the Al@@ ko@@ t does not move , sun@@ sh@@ ings , a decent man , intelligent , pleasant communication and , where we see life , you have not seen their lives .
I joined him and the following 3 weeks , the city of the city and also about 5 on a day , the city of the city and also about 5 on a day .
the money has got the money , so much for living .
the man taught us how to offer the evening aid to ho@@ tel ho@@ tels and on farms that are closed down .
we have done exactly as much as it would be for the 2 to 3 days , and then on ...
at some point , fe@@ ver , and I decided that it would no longer be that ...
I took a flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki , from home .
and , by the way , I still regret .
these 40 days were perhaps the best in my life .
I have recently referred to F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : &apos; there is a poor justification &apos; .
therefore , I am not going to look back and try and try not to recall what has been achieved in history for the re@@ aring of human animals and what has been achieved .
I am not going to judge whether these tests can be regarded as a success or a failure .
I am also going to avoid excessive sources , even though I would like to rely on the idea of my most important teacher , T@@ o@@ om@@ as Pa@@ ul@@ a : all my thoughts have been borro@@ wed from somewhere if only to remember where exactly where .
the most striking step in Estonia today is the re@@ aring of the citizens of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect person .
we do not grow her , as we grow a child - in good faith that a person will be a man .
we are raising it in such a way as the ruling class before itself - which one person must be , that he or she should be allowed to live and speak in Estonia .
censorship is perfect .
although the local ruling class became partly a year ago , some of the educational methods are just as frigh@@ tening if they were in the previous ruling class , now impover@@ ished a@@ x@@ is - their bru@@ tality does not go down to any of the previous ones .
they are quite different .
Latvia be@@ er is the mar@@ ch of the new era of the age of the new era .
State leaders , 0.@@ 5 , of the decisions made
it is not only the politicians who are here in the ruling class not only those politicians who get a pen@@ ny for their work , but also those who do the policy on a voluntary ( deliberately ) : write the Mik@@ k &apos;s mu@@ d@@ d@@ led , the m@@ ur@@ ky people around them from the EU , boycot@@ ting , the gesture of sa@@ b@@ o@@ tage in the EU , when the terrible people around that room are being boycot@@ ting , a gesture that is sa@@ b@@ o@@ tage .
they are only willing to stay in the case of EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber ( the expression of the English about people who live in a room where only the opinions that are suited to them , such as their own F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k friends , etc . ) , but it is not possible in Estonia .
there are still some of the contributions who think or is doing something that is un@@ be@@ arable in the ro@@ ck .
and that is the dis@@ gus@@ ting of the &apos; no &apos; side and the &apos; no &apos; side of the w@@ et &apos; .
we have a large number of politicians who know exactly how a person can lo@@ g up many children to lo@@ cate how to do work , to get a lot of salaries when to think about what to see how to separate the sick of how to break the sick of how to separate a sick person when you can be the sick of how to die .
very important positions .
if their public speeches were bu@@ ried by something other than what they themselves have said , they have been w@@ rest@@ ling , insul@@ ted , ju@@ mp@@ s , hy@@ ste@@ ria about their public speeches .
the fact that people in a number of European countries travel with &apos; car drivers &apos; , and it is legally permitted , do not undermine their opinion .
zero tolerance is the only per@@ missible cra@@ dle in every area , but zero tolerance is not a neg@@ li@@ gent , but a sp@@ ilt .
class hatred and race - only like anything like me .
poli@@ cy@@ makers only manage to open up only sou@@ l , but never with the heart .
they believe that every &apos; measure &apos; to improve society is working and is worthwhile .
they are fortuna@@ te enough that we have an adequate size of the V@@ ar@@ di@@ dis , the psy@@ ch@@ ologically disabled bo@@ w@@ ers who are ju@@ mp@@ ing through every window - without feeling the pain .
therefore , it seems to us , if a cle@@ ver pe@@ l-@@ pe@@ -@@ pe@@ -@@ pe@@ -@@ pe@@ d@@ den pe@@ er is emo@@ tionally flawed , that this is reasonable .
some of the words that will certainly bring us a little bit , for example , tomorrow , a refugee , a woman , violence , the work of work and others .
if you can believe everything that self-@@ serving officials , activists and politicians ( such are only a small part of all groups , but they are able to put on track in such a way that the whole of society is sad@@ den@@ ed ) and write , a citizen is not only the vas@@ sal , labor@@ atory and un@@ pleasant , but also at temporary free , without brain .
but let us not believe , do not tolerate coer@@ ci@@ on , do not stop drinking .
in any case , the Est@@ onian man is running as much as it wants , and not as much as a country allows .
the Est@@ onian person will , in any case , tolerate more if it is not forced to tolerate him .
the Est@@ onian people will not change their behaviour two months before the elections , so that , after having achieved this goal , we can turn our backs on their popular di@@ ets and again , not only inside , but also to ex@@ pel what is in@@ accessible to brain fat kil@@ os quickly .
who does the other thing is not the right position .
I do not believe that a single person can be re@@ plan@@ ted .
I believe that it is possible to teach a person .
to drin@@ k sensi@@ bly , I love your own family , to be a hard-@@ working , poli@@ te , a le@@ ar@@ ner for not only friends but also to society as a whole .
to teach us , it is not always time to scra@@ p , ban , ban , to put it into the cor@@ ner of the media , thro@@ wing the w@@ ings of the media .
the teaching must serve as an example .
a bo@@ om@@ ing politician is talking about the loss of tobacco ?
a poli@@ ce@@ man , at a free time , is doing a fine for over@@ shoo@@ ting the spe@@ eds of speed ?
and , then , will it be left between my colleague ...
I have such a ri@@ val idea that perhaps we should try to re@@ open the prevailing class once again .
to them , do not drin@@ k in secret .
drin@@ k , drin@@ k openly : you be@@ at a ra@@ de , in the eyes of the people as a whole .
to force the speed to go only openly - the cars of the govern@@ ors , but also by private cars , be it all the red .
if you prevail , then govern as you would govern y@@ ourselves .
perhaps it is a disgrace , then , when words and deeds do not go together .
or we can know that we ourselves want to be governed by those most ban@@ kers .
because we all of us the Al@@ ti@@ ans , we are what we do not want at all at all .
where are you fleeing for themselves ?
for this weekend , ra@@ ins are being allowed for this weekend , so it would be time to take one good line .
why not tri@@ m@@ bled the wh@@ al@@ es !
Mr R@@ E g@@ or@@ ge@@ ou@@ s contains recommendations for nine habits , which should help you achieve a more rela@@ xed and better meaning .
it is argued that the first changes should be seen in the first edi@@ tion of the first Year .
a bus driver was saved from eight el@@ o@@ gen@@ s , not knowing that the do@@ gs actually have the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ where I put these eight cu@@ t@@ backs , I would have been thrown out of do@@ gs with do@@ gs &apos; , a jo@@ ke of the bus and coach O@@ g , who got the motor@@ way around the shop with no other guard around the journey .
very soon , however , the ow@@ ner of the do@@ g of asylum , for whom it failed to understand why they were taken away from his homes .
Mr O@@ le@@ g , a bus driver , said he was already working as a bus driver since the beginning of the 1990s , but such a case has not happened in his career since the beginning of the 1990s , but this case has not happened in his career since the beginning of his career .
near Charter , I noticed that something little running around the road is running around the road .
I thought this was a pro@@ x@@ y , but it came out that there were four pu@@ ri@@ t &apos; , a bus driver recalled .
he went to the heart of bul@@ let and he suspended passengers with full bus , in order to keep the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
the &apos; harm started &apos; , the cars have been travelling over and do@@ gs w@@ o@@ ked &apos; , in the words of O@@ le@@ n .
he added , so that passengers were reasonable , and they were given a great deal of jo@@ y .
K@@ u@@ ci@@ ans were somewhat afraid at the beginning , but then it was a bro@@ ker .
on board the ho@@ sts on board , the bus driver went on a new front , because the driving schedule needed to follow .
in travelling to the sho@@ es again , he saw a further four small do@@ gs there .
it was a German sheep co@@ ck .
they were so immediate and it was immediately possible to see that they were concerned .
do@@ gs were fine , absolutely sta@@ ggering .
the first point was , of course , that someone wanted them to get rid of them &apos; , a bus driver spoke of them , for that reason , he decided to po@@ cket a f@@ ool bus .
&apos;@@ I also took these four cu@@ t@@ backs and returned to the police &apos; , reminded O@@ g .
the law enforcement has been conta@@ cted by the prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers in T@@ all@@ in@@ ana , whose staff had to come to the sho@@ es according to the Baltic plant .
however , did the bus driver not be temp@@ ted to take a po@@ et ?
that was the point .
one of the C@@ ul@@ tural po@@ is@@ s was so beautiful and calm .
a nice like adult do@@ g said &apos; , Mr O@@ g said .
but where do I put these eight el@@ o@@ gen@@ s ?
I would have been thrown out of my do@@ g with do@@ gs .
we still have a small child .
he has added the assets &apos; , put him in the anne@@ x .
in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , the Chair of the European Commission , who has truly given eight German sheep do@@ gs , who are the prison@@ ers of two and a half months .
on the same day , however , the ow@@ ner had to come to a pu@@ ts@@ -@@ family .
&apos;@@ We did not even form@@ alise them even come in and gave them the same back &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ the ow@@ ner of do@@ gs was very ang@@ ry , but he said that they had the only house on a vis@@ ual scale and the head of bus might have had the question of whether they were &apos; , spoke to them &apos; .
however , the head of asylum added , however , that it is a good thing that the bus driver , at the same time , cut off the line by the bus driver at the end of the road , and therefore did not happen to them .
in fact , it was very good from the bus driver that he responded .
we have encountered in the landscape where , if necessary , you simply cannot get out of the best will with conventional vehicles .
that is where the A@@ T@@ V is the solution .
the A@@ T@@ V , which is in operation in a military area , gave an overview of the house for the Catal@@ a !
there is nothing new in the use of vehicles in the military structures of ligh@@ t@@ weight and good per@@ cen@@ tages .
the need for them has already emerged in the course of the Second World War , the need for them had already been given a decade later .
simpli@@ city and strength
already in 195@@ 6 , under the name of a mechan@@ ical mu@@ d@@ la , under the name of a mechan@@ ical mu@@ d@@ dle , which was now under the name of a mechan@@ ical th@@ in of the Second World War in the year of the Second World War , a vehicle for eva@@ cu@@ ation .
it is a little strange to say a little strange for improvement .
it is hard to imagine the vehicle .
a her@@ o platform , a man and a ho@@ le : all , all the luxury .
in direct terms , over-@@ ze@@ ro-@@ f@@ lor@@ k engine@@ ers from the engine@@ er were too has@@ ti@@ ly set out too much a stra@@ it that has started their production from too much h@@ aste .
however , what matters in the war is much more man@@ age@@ able than comfor@@ t .
this category was not challenged by the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese j@@ ung@@ le in Vietnam .
it is easy , less than five hundred kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of more than five hundred kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of more than five hundred kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s , in the places where , as a result of their capacity in super@@ flu@@ ous , has had to show the brak@@ es .
in the large majority , vehicles with a 5@@ 0-@@ kil@@ os of chic@@ ken has been used , both in terms of po@@ pp@@ y and a re@@ vita@@ lisation .
it was , at times , also made ligh@@ ter , without set@@ tling anti-@@ tan@@ k weapons .
however , this lor@@ ry has come down , however , and it has happened , the driver was able to shift the ro@@ tation system in the last resort and to let it get it so far low that it was possible to lead a k@@ ick in the sheep sheep .
between now and 19@@ 70 , they were prepared for 11 2@@ 40 to 19@@ 70 , and were in the army up to 19@@ 80 , when the vic@@ in@@ ity of H@@ M@@ M@@ W@@ R was ex@@ changed .
after two decades , the A@@ T@@ C military distri@@ ct had a marg@@ inal meaning .
they come back to the pil@@ l after the ro@@ ck fell in New York and US soldiers found themselves in the deser@@ t landscape of Iraq and Afghanistan .
it is where the knowledge and understanding of what is needed is something that ch@@ oo@@ ses the vo@@ id H@@ at@@ we@@ e and the personnel of the vo@@ id .
as the A@@ T@@ C does not provide considerable protection , they are not directly the best option to carry out the battle .
however , a fast and dynamic machine is suitable for carrying out specific tasks .
for example , in a pi@@ g and rescue operations , for example .
at present , thousands of AT@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ R have been in use .
most of them , like the defence of the X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50 , who are in the region of the X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50 , but were enri@@ ched in accordance with the needs of the army .
there are names such as K@@ aw@@ as@@ a@@ u Mu@@ le , the names of the K@@ aw@@ as@@ a@@ u Mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ d@@ us@@ a@@ k@@ on Mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ d@@ t S@@ ab@@ man , Y@@ am@@ man R@@ hin@@ al and Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c C@@ at , and the ever-@@ wid@@ ening option of the leading military AT@@ A@@ T@@ V@@ s of A@@ T@@ V@@ s .
in 2013 , the Pol@@ ar report concluded a five-year agreement with the A@@ O@@ CO@@ M dual M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 4 and a separate five-year agreement in the S@@ port of S@@ port S@@ port , S@@ port , S@@ port , S@@ port , on S@@ port , on behalf of M@@ V@@ 8@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ s made from the Pol@@ ar and B@@ la@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ B@@ 8@@ 1 and innovative M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 4 , and the specific five-year agreement in a special five-year agreement on the part of M@@ V@@ 8@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ s ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) dual M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ R@@ 4 , and a cut in the form of a cut in the form of mobility after a 50 c@@ ali@@ om@@ ic weapons .
before we entered the M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 market , the Pol@@ ar reached the supply of M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 in the Pol@@ ar .
in the case of M@@ V@@ 700 , it is the 7@@ 00@@ r@@ d T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man , which has been included and wants to wal@@ k , the dual fuel tan@@ k to reach larger distan@@ ces , strengthened ra@@ va@@ ge and some military equipment with which the farmer , or the pe@@ ts that do not have to start .
in the same way , alongside the Pol@@ ar@@ se A@@ T@@ D@@ s , both in Iraq and in Afghanistan , is equipped with ar@@ bi@@ es , b@@ agg@@ age and some other elements that have been used in their b@@ el@@ t and with some other elements that are useful in their b@@ reat@@ h , but what is necessary in the battle zone .
a vehicle that is considering 750 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s can take away almost its own body weight , which is to say , 5@@ 70 kil@@ o ta@@ p .
the capacity of the engine will also suff@@ ice to carry ligh@@ ter re@@ ba@@ tes and nu@@ mber@@ ing parts .
as a change in the guarantee that has been removed , makes it possible to ta@@ p from point A to B b@@ agg@@ age from A to B , which is the size of the size of the small , but the do@@ zen of them .
subsequently , M@@ -@@ G@@ las@@ i &apos;s improved version of A@@ 1 , which is more powerful than the original 20 hor@@ ses of M@@ -@@ G@@ for@@ a , and subsequently strengthened , with the strengthened framework in A@@ 2 , which is even better in terms of dra@@ gging and sho@@ es , and A@@ A@@ 3 , which comb@@ ines A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 , which comb@@ ines A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 .
the Nor@@ th@@ gi@@ ans were in fact already in 1997 and in 1998 in 1998 , where the medical bri@@ ens used them to eva@@ cu@@ ate w@@ ounded .
at the same time , they also reduced the burden of their own mobile soldiers , by transferring instead of a la@@ g that would otherwise have been paid off by the market .
if the majority of A@@ T@@ V@@ s , which are used in force in force in force , there are some exceptions .
these distinguished spiri@@ ts are the name of Pro@@ w@@ ler in Pro@@ w@@ ler , prepared by P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x , which has been successfully used throughout the world in all kinds of battle , intelligence and rescue missions .
according to the producer , they have been presented for the first time a decade ago of the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks that have been introduced for the first time 10 years ago , which are typical of the remaining bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks at ordinary use , both in terms of man@@ power , re@@ sili@@ ence and safety .
as a result of both the construction and the greatest of the ordinary CS@@ R , Mr Pro@@ w@@ ler has had a wide range of vari@@ ations , both in terms of its construction and capacity .
it is quicker , more robust , more stable and able to carry as well as to the greatest difficulties than other vehicles .
for example , when in the case of the ordinary A@@ TV , the leader in maintaining the balance of the vehicle has to constantly play their body offices and use to manoeuvre , to speed up and de@@ regulate both of them , the management of Pro@@ stance is rather similar to the management of the car .
however , in the end , it is no difference whether it is the concept and use of Pro@@ w@@ ler , G@@ man , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or another A@@ TV - concept and use are all similar to that of everyone .
and it is clear that , in circumstances where defence costs have a broad margin of defence costs , and instead of having a smaller , smaller , under@@ m@@ y@@ mo@@ tive , a secure target for the sole destination , will be ligh@@ tly and quick , small vehicles to stay in order to stay in the service .
&apos;@@ M@@ y o died , but I am not &apos; , remains a broad s@@ mi@@ le in the I@@ ron M@@ an in the form of I@@ ron 7@@ 3@@ 3 in the fin@@ i@@ š@@ is .
it is true that , in the course of the entire semi@@ -@@ long tri@@ at@@ l@@ on , no s@@ mi@@ le has s@@ k@@ im@@ med R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t .
moreover , in running a 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres in drin@@ k , he got a inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor : &apos; I spoke with one person during a drin@@ k , one man be@@ at and won@@ dered : &apos; The In@@ tel@@ and , you had also said , &apos; .
at the earth , Ra@@ v@@ o , who had had their energy dis@@ pen@@ sing , some of them went to the h@@ ung@@ ry .
on the recommendation of the T@@ re@@ en .
the &apos; A@@ in-@@ AL@@ AR Ju@@ a@@ ison has said that the f@@ lam@@ es may wal@@ k away , that there is no point in going down , because there is such up@@ take here , and there is no difference in time whether drin@@ ks or s@@ oo@@ d@@ ball wal@@ ks , saying that he took the lead and hear the words of the tri@@ ump@@ h .
it also got a b@@ reat@@ h when he was wal@@ ked , and so , after being able to get the fin@@ ishing line to the left and a better inter@@ view .
as if there were no 1.@@ 9 kilometres of sw@@ im@@ ming , 90 kilometres of cy@@ c@@ ling and 21.@@ 1 kilometres of drin@@ k .
&apos;@@ I think that my tra@@ ce is also that I can enjoy this competition &apos; , recognises the 16 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of 16 k@@ g in the 16 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of 16 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of 16 k@@ g .
and , as far as the inter@@ views are concerned , that was my wish to have taken an inter@@ view after the final inter@@ view .
I have been able to give an inter@@ view after every con@@ test , and I had hoped that it would be good to be able to do so after O@@ te@@ g@@ n@@ es .
I thought that then , everything would be fine if I am not in the West ba@@ g ma@@ ps after I@@ ron &apos; ; on the contrary , the head of Ra@@ iv@@ o proposed the fin@@ ishing line of Ra@@ iv@@ o , along with the fin@@ ishing line of Ra@@ iv@@ o proposed in the fin@@ ishing line .
there was also reason : in R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t 1.@@ 9 kilometres of 46 minutes and 24 seconds , 90 km of whe@@ at for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21.@@ 1 kilometres for 2 hours and for 21.@@ 1 kilometres .
&apos;@@ M@@ y heart has now been given to the tri@@ ump@@ h now , the Ra@@ v@@ o , who was already c@@ rying in the fin@@ gers , that he was running at the fin@@ gers at sport , and it took a c@@ at ta@@ ck .
I have already registered myself on the part of the G@@ ood F@@ d@@ in - 2@@ 30 kilometres from the T@@ all@@ in@@ us on the basis of the whe@@ el !
so , tomorrow , to tra@@ ce again .
the third f@@ esti@@ val Day will be a strong wind .
one in the face of the pu@@ ppe@@ t of the A@@ th@@ re@@ w , one of the w@@ o@@ es of the A@@ th@@ re@@ w who is trying to fly by wind .
because of the future , many of the f@@ esti@@ val ar@@ sen@@ ts have been mentioned that you and your eyes are on the s@@ and .
I think we have gone quite well .
we have done a good job and with our works and work , the head of the Police man@@ ager , Mr S@@ human , will tell them how they have had their first night 24 days for them .
S@@ human@@ er says that , today , pat@@ rol@@ s police officers and fast reactions to the streets and are also communic@@ ating with people - perhaps they have questions and they also want to know how to get a rapid reaction .
in the space of two days , the police have had to deal with some of the bat@@ tles and also with drugs .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have also had some of the large quantities of nar@@ co@@ tic substances , but we are going to be summar@@ ised when the Weber has passed &apos; , is a word for S@@ human .
some hundred hundred people have been going through a police station who has been going through in two days &apos; time has been going on in two days &apos; time .
fortunately , there has been no need to resolve extreme incidents by the police .
by the way , S@@ pea@@ ker says that if the sky has to be ste@@ ad@@ fas@@ tly and horizontal to rain , they do not have a lot of work .
one head of the Hague police has once said that the rain is like an additional child .
in the area of the We@@ e@@ k@@ er@@ u , the P@@ ise R@@ ight has also done a state of sta@@ teh@@ ood , where things that have been found and where the missing things can be coun@@ ted .
by the way , the police lost away from one of the things that they need , the good people lost in in@@ vention by good people .
look at the vi@@ de@@ os mentioned by Mr S@@ human@@ er .
the Weber f@@ esti@@ val of the Baltic Sea b@@ os@@ s G@@ un@@ na@@ r , on the front hand , to the f@@ esti@@ val that Finland had first got back to Finland and its owners went back to the enlargement process under the Ri@@ ver , but on the back of the P@@ ä@@ n@@ us , and so the case was that of the f@@ esti@@ val , and so was the sale of the f@@ esti@@ val in Estonia .
Mr G@@ un@@ na@@ r said that they have committed themselves to 25 000 visitors a day , but the pro@@ s will only be coun@@ ted when f@@ esti@@ val .
the pre@@ occupation for the streets has already started in September .
&apos;@@ W@@ here we had the information in favour of the city that construction begins at the last site , the ho@@ tel comes down to it &apos; , the change to which G@@ un@@ na@@ r is going to be faced with this year .
at the moment , none of the K@@ op@@ pa does not see any of the K@@ op@@ pa , but it is to think that if the K@@ O@@ P did not go to the May this year .
so perhaps the day we could have moved from it &apos; , he explains why this f@@ esti@@ val has moved the f@@ esti@@ val this year .
the banking regime is going to go through this year .
there are a thousand and a half a thousand , a thousand - the police , the comm@@ and , volunte@@ ers , traders , the security authority , and so on .
the most difficult thing was , according to the Weber , to have a du@@ o , Cha@@ dian of Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ po@@ s .
after all , men are now the in@@ dispu@@ table figure in the bo@@ y world .
why Mr Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers had found a difficult period and how G@@ un@@ na@@ r commen@@ ted on G@@ un@@ na@@ r that two of the artists were cancelled , are already already vi@@ de@@ os .
it is coming from the West to come from the road to Estonia .
in the north of Estonia there has already been a lot of noise , and we can see the individual re@@ ba@@ tes .
this afternoon , the L@@ un@@ ding service was also a wa@@ ke@@ -up call .
today , mainly in the north of Estonia , there are many sides in the north .
the images of the weather are rapidly moving from the West to the West .
the outbreak of the south-@@ west range from 18 , on islands and on the coast of 18 , on the islands and on the coast , but with the th@@ us@@ k can lead to stronger wind@@ s &apos; , is on the website of the weather service .
however , much greater mo@@ ck@@ ery is ra@@ ging on the east of South Finland and Russia in the east of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg .
fortunately , however , the wind@@ s are brea@@ thing from the West and the age in Estonia , and therefore , at least for the time being , there is no risk at least that the major stor@@ ms would turn to Estonia .
the F@@ in@@ ns organised a dance by their men .
when , 11 years ago in R@@ ak@@ al@@ a was the first to be held in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is , the organ@@ ise@@ rs obviously failed to see the northern neighbours taking an example from a small city of Estonia .
today , however , in the west of Finland , we are holding the first Finnish woman to dance .
the representatives of the City of L@@ o@@ re@@ e were so enthusias@@ tic about the last friendship city in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is , were so c@@ lu@@ m@@ sy of the men who took place in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is , the R@@ ak@@ h@@ e was announced by the R@@ ak@@ mi@@ e L@@ ab@@ i@@ i Pi@@ h@@ r@@ k .
&apos;@@ This is what is happening today in Finland , under the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery of L@@ and@@ a in Finland , where there are 100 man V@@ ir@@ u@@ s , where there are 100 man V@@ ir@@ u@@ s , where there is 100 men from V@@ ir@@ u@@ ll &apos; , in the words of Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
according to the Pi@@ balance , this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two town of friendship .
at the same time , this will be a celeb@@ ration of the Est@@ onian and Finnish re@@ public@@ s .
there is also a ro@@ cket at 69 as the winner of the previous season , Kar@@ l R@@ in@@ k@@ u@@ b@@ ga .
&apos;@@ I have the honour of being one of the sa@@ to who , with his participation in Finland , for which V@@ ir@@ u &apos;s men is capable of &apos; , he said .

the S@@ reg@@ ron@@ rich of Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans is based on a burden model .
first Est@@ onian men &apos;s dance was held in 2006 , while until now the last in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is .
although the media attention has mainly been paid to the P@@ ory and the We@@ e@@ k@@ on that is taking place there , that is not the only music identification for this weekend .
the In@@ ces@@ t A@@ sa@@ a@@ k@@ ist f@@ esti@@ val will also have loy@@ al f@@ ans .
one of them , for example , wri@@ tes T@@ wit@@ ter@@ i : &apos; I sell the Weber tic@@ kets so that I can go to the In@@ do@@ cu@@ ment &apos; .
and why not .
in addition to domestic artists , there will also be coming from the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ as , Finland , Lithuania , Hungary , England and elsewhere .
the f@@ esti@@ val being organised in the World forest is surprised by the oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ ts that exist there , too , because of a ma@@ gic w@@ and .
one of them , Lu@@ cas Ro@@ se , was not in T@@ wit@@ ter today in T@@ wit@@ ter , when Estonia has a beautiful place .
however , the visitors have also narro@@ wed the division of pig@@ s .
in order to be able to take part in the In@@ ci@@ ent f@@ esti@@ val , the G@@ alle@@ ts themselves .
although the weekend has come in the weekend , there has been no re@@ signa@@ tion of your action .
it is still a hand@@ ful of work , but others are also trying to s@@ pu@@ r other people into action .
those concerns could be forgotten and , together with the more expensive , de@@ par@@ tures .
take the time for us to enjoy a few s@@ cor@@ ners in some of the ways , in the ro@@ man@@ tics .
when we talk about the subject on the subject , the f@@ lam@@ es , major plans , perhaps they will also allow promises ... which , in the light of a moment , is already in the process of going .
the other party , however , st@@ ops his words .
it is a lot of une@@ as@@ y , it is difficult to focus on some action .
you may not have to depend on what is happening at the moment , but about what has happened before .
it is also in a difficult position that we are able to act quickly and in a rational manner .
it is possible that you can help someone from the lur@@ ch today because you have enough wisdom and determination .
rather , it is a matter of concern for money and business .

if others go across the border , then you will take that path .
better placed to feel in a more custom@@ ary environment by doing things which can and I give them jo@@ y .
obviously , you are not asking for new knowledge and ad@@ ven@@ tures .
c@@ rying out is an activity , which I think you will never really be full of .
today , too , you are in the room .
however , what is happening is not normal , however .
it may be that , in spite of a free one , we still have to deal with the car@@ r@@ yo@@ ver of the t@@ reas@@ ury j@@ ams .

as a result of the worrying violations associated with information , personal data on the mother of a child , including information about whether they are sexu@@ ally active .

the table seems to have been an over@@ statement document , which was intended to send to the guardian of the night .
the document contains notes as to when some children have to be waiting home or whether they can take the contact with staff in order to get them .
there have been an alarming number of details on some children .
a 15@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y has been wor@@ ded with a warning : &apos; when personnel take contact in order to obtain a permit for the search and / or s@@ top@@ t / US@@ B@@ -@@ B@@ -@@ B@@ -@@ B@@ -@@ B@@ et@@ ter due to the suspicion of un@@ suitable sexual material , this authorisation must be given &apos; .
it is also known that a 17@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l , who will receive 18 in just three months &apos; time and is released from welfare institutions , a suicide attempt is so much that staff will have to call the emergency in the event of his flight .
it was noted about a 16@@ -@@ year-old condition for the bo@@ y , it was noted that he was outside and &apos; conta@@ cts with staff at a later date in order to catch him &apos; .
although , in the case listed , only a accommodation unit has been mentioned , where children are kept and not their address , the details are still much enough to be able to find them .
the 2006 data lea@@ vers came out when F@@ air@@ fa@@ x , the mother &apos;s F@@ air@@ fa@@ x , with his experience in terms of health and service minis@@ tries and child protection , since his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter &apos;s da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter four years ago .
he agreed to share his concerns now that his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had received 18 and late systems .
the hear@@ t-@@ r@@ ending decision to hand over child protection was handed over after a violent incident at home , and this case is one of the ever more complaints concerning family violence , which parents are making against their children .
it had worrying consequences , which the mother never anticipated , for example , his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter was able to get seven criminal charges within six months after leaving his or her home , he was relo@@ cated to hundreds of kilometres in home and crea@@ ture , in which he successfully found how to succeed but then he returned without informing the parents , and then he returned and facilitation two his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters after leaving his or her home , after leaving his or her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter after leaving his or her home , he was relo@@ cated and facilitated by his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters after leaving his or her home . the relationship between the trend and the older man .
the relationship with the first to the bo@@ y@@ man , the 17 years , with whom the welfare establish@@ ments allowed a woman to stay on a regular ho@@ tel at the time of a woman ended in a regular ho@@ tel , ended in a few days after a young man was charged , because of this relationship , an accus@@ ation was made to the child &apos;s sexual status after the age of 18 .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w out the system in a worse situation than when entering it ? &apos; ask the mother .

he is voting in favour of setting up an agency that would allow the health and service minis@@ try to have children in the first few weeks , after taking them under care , before they move into homes .
this would enable them to understand better how children intera@@ ct with the others and what the dangers and needs associated with them , especially in educational terms .
the government of the state is looking for new ways of reducing the need for children to be placed in home , seeking , among other things , to better support their parents .
with a definite guide@@ line on the assistance packages , which are funded during four years to USD 62 million , the aim is to help children in domestic care in better arrangements for situations .
in addition , the two-@@ million two-@@ year experim@@ ent allows a two-@@ year experim@@ ent which was released from last October , offering professional carers to at least 28 children , in order to help them get out of welfare or prevent them from entering it .
the representative of the depart@@ ment said that the information period was not officially reported as it happened , even though the mother claims that the two departments had been informed within a few months after the incident .
the depart@@ ment is now working with a service provider to analyse the case .
&apos;@@ D@@ o every allegations of private data will be taken very seriously and we are working to ensure that it has not nega@@ tively impact on the young people concerned &apos; .
