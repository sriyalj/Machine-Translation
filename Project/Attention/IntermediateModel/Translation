is there a solution at last to avoid the th@@ or@@ ny ro@@ b@@ ot@@ s ?
for Michael R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , answering the phone is often a waste of time .
his S@@ port C@@ it@@ ty Pi@@ z@@ za P@@ u@@ b , based in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ os in New York , depends on customers ring ring and or@@ dering can@@ i@@ ons , stic@@ ks and po@@ ta@@ to@@ es .
however , for a large part of the time , this is an automatic message that is trying to push through fraud .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is getting to the point that it does not allow other gene@@ ro@@ rs to take us &apos; , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old ba@@ r ow@@ ner said .
aid is on track , albeit slowly .
over the past year , at the government &apos;s insti@@ gation on mobile phones , new tools have been put in place to prevent un@@ wanted &apos; ro@@ b@@ ot@@ ou@@ tle@@ ts &apos; .
the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al Com@@ mis@@ si@@ des has proposed enabling telephone companies to block more di@@ r@@ ty calls and hopes to bur@@ y petitions with heavy fines .
according to the experts , these steps are not a definitive solution , but they are a good start .
the f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist and shareholders in non-@@ generous countries should protect people from un@@ wanted calls from long-@@ distance distributors .
however , the fra@@ ud@@ sters are not interested in breaking the law .
fra@@ ud@@ sters reach people cheap@@ ly and easily , using &apos; automatic voters &apos; , which automatically make a lot of speeches at the same time .
it is estimated that the Americans receive tens of millions of ro@@ b@@ ot@@ s a day .
of course , not all of them are fraudulent .
pharma@@ cies , for example , send automa@@ ted messages about compliance with prescri@@ ptions .
however , all too often , the situation is as follows : be inde@@ b@@ ted to the tax authority ; Mic@@ ro@@ soft calls for your computer to be done ; free cru@@ ids !
in addition , j@@ uni@@ or users use complex technologies , which show a telephone call for a local or important figure , such as a tax authority .
the implementation of appropriate measures for &apos; f@@ usion &apos; figures would aggra@@ vate fraud and would help US consumers to save millions of dollars , as stated in the S@@ ec@@ re@@ tari@@ at@@ -General &apos;s document .
telephone companies and independent applications are able to scre@@ en or block un@@ wanted speeches , compared to the databases of the known problem numbers and looking at dubious behaviour , such as the number , which calls for many people in non-@@ call permits .
leading service providers will also have the tools that add warnings to in@@ coming speeches such as &apos; Ty@@ n@@ ically sha@@ m &apos; , but they are not available to all the telephone and many customers with a re@@ paid card .
they can be ordered from V@@ eri@@ z@@ on and S@@ pr@@ in@@ t for an additional charge .
some And@@ ro@@ id@@ -@@ phone phones , including Google Pi@@ x@@ el , call j@@ un@@ k calls free of charge .
a Mul@@ ti@@ media producer , J@@ en V@@ ar@@ gas ( 39 ) Or@@ din@@ o@@ st F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ as , said that his A@@ T &amp; T application will mark and block certain fraudulent speeches on his mobile phone , but he has given up on telephone lines .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me take very rare conver@@ sa@@ tions from figures I do not know &apos; said in War@@ gas .
applications such as Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il and N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bi offer free but limited relief to domestic phones .
in the case of Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il , the operator must allow &apos; conditional calls to be directed &apos; , which will drive forward speeches if the route is not answered or occupied .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available for all domestic telephone providers and does not work with parents , va@@ se@@ -based telephone lines .
it is also possible to buy v@@ ines , some of them quite large , which are blocking calls on home phones .
V@@ eri@@ z@@ on also tests the display of warnings about sha@@ dy calls in the number of home te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es .
telephone companies are already able to block certain speeches that are fraudulent .
F@@ c@@ c has proposed rules for the form@@ alisation of such practices and allowing the blocking of other calls for suspicion of fraud .
this means that V@@ eri@@ z@@ on can block a tax@@ -free number , which speaks for remuneration , but never begins at all .
it would also be possible for operators to block speeches in which they know that they are not legitimate , such as the 9@@ 11 reference figures .
these rules still need to be fin@@ e-@@ tu@@ ned .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , a public order block in a no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit consumer union , said that these developments are &apos; hopeful &apos; , but do not protect consumers from all un@@ wanted calls .
firstly , applications will not be generous to certain types of char@@ gers , such as creditors and political campaigns .
moreover , the fran@@ c rules would cover only false figures , according to Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y .
not all ro@@ tten speeches are intended to be tri@@ f@@ ling .
the consumer union wants telephone companies to make tools for blocking calls accessible to all consumers free of charge .
in the long term , the Fle@@ c industry supports efforts to confirm that it is really the char@@ ger that he claims to be .
perhaps one day it will be possible to see the smart phone from the green poultry when the char@@ ter is legitimate .
U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tele@@ com , a lob@@ by@@ ist for tele@@ com companies , says that it can take several years to introduce it , but it would be a powerful tool against the Roma people .
F@@ c@@ c is also looking for ways of ending the succes@@ sion of in@@ ex@@ or@@ able speeches to consumers who change the number .
if you register yourself now in a no-@@ call permit but obtain a new figure later on , the distribu@@ tor may not know that and may be bo@@ gged down in the new line .
&apos;@@ R@@ ob@@ o@@ th@@ el@@ in@@ ers will stay &apos; , A@@ ar@@ on F@@ os@@ s N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bi , a service to block calls for mobile and home te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es , said .
&apos;@@ The@@ y are criminal and find a new way to by@@ pass any system .
but it is our job to make it as difficult as possible for them &apos; .
there are several logical measures that consumers should take .
do not turn up on the phone if you do not know the number .
yes , this is unfortunately not practical for business direc@@ tories such as S@@ por@@ ts C@@ it@@ y .
cut off un@@ wanted speeches .
do not speak up against or press any bu@@ tton .
when you deal with them , they can mention you as someone who reac@@ ts and bur@@ y you with more speeches .
if possible , close the number after your speech .
use the applications to block calls .
if you have concerns about privacy , check the rules of the application in order to see whether it shares your information or contact data with the distributors .
do not issue personal data to the alar@@ mis@@ ts , such as the bank account or the social security figure .

the Russian railway is expl@@ oring the possibility of launching the S@@ t Peter@@ bu@@ ri@@ -@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ Berlin travel@@ ler .
the Russian railway is expl@@ oring the possibility of outs@@ our@@ cing the Berlin S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg train via Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad , reported by Vik@@ tor G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in Inter@@ fa@@ x to Se@@ ve@@ ro-@@ Z@@ a@@ pa@@ d , the Director of the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad railway .
the traffic monu@@ ment talks about the fact that , from an economic point of view , the re@@ deployment of Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ Berlin trains is hardly possible .
and we are offering a second route - Ber@@ li@@ in-@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d@@ -@@ Peter@@ s@@ burg .
there are technical options for this in terms of both infrastructure and water management &apos; , said G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in .
another point was made by Mr G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in that there are already Russian trains that can exchange track wid@@ ths and continue to move on to a European track record .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in thinks that this direction is in the prospect , because right now the inhabitants of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg and the whole nor@@ th-@@ west of Russia have to travel to Germany through Moscow and B@@ rest@@ i .
as a possible option , the press spokes@@ person for Latvia &apos;s Del@@ f@@ i , M@@ Ã¢@@ ris O@@ z@@ ol@@ s , who says that there is no concrete decision at the moment , has been confirmed by the Latvian rail route , confirmed by the Latvian Del@@ f@@ i .
Latvia &apos;s railways , together with partners , including Russian railways , are looking for the possibility of increasing competitiveness in serving the flow of passengers so that rail transport can compete with road transport .
the Chinese company , which came to Estonia , immediately made EUR 100 million in a ba@@ il-@@ out .

many Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans already have their own 4@@ 8-@@ day working week .
however , it is not as they would expect it to be a day of business .
it has been created by a modern planning of premises or an open office .
in Se@@ in@@ te@@ ta &apos;s office , the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Business Re@@ vi@@ w gives us staff for nearly 1.5 hours a day , almost an entire day of work , takes an empty week .
however , when it comes to four working days and three rest days in the week of Thursday , such a forced solution is worse than that .
for 1.5 hours of working time , the focus on family and ho@@ b@@ bies or rec@@ re@@ ation , mixed work , increasing irri@@ tation and anxi@@ ety , and declining the will to work , has been spent with difficulties .
how do you finance the vehicles of the company ?
in a changing consumer society , the financing opportunities for the vehicles of the enlarged companies have become a means of financing , with more and more companies going to full service , or rather a more mandatory long-term author@@ ita@@ tive .
vehicle le@@ asing and le@@ asing are two clearly different financial transactions , which involve a variety of responsibilities and expectations , but which often still cause confusion .
according to the view of Vil@@ l T@@ be@@ et , the head of the international author &apos;s company , of Estonia &apos;s sales and marketing leader , that companies are increasingly moving towards full service , and that the possibility of long-term ren@@ ting is increasingly being used .
the fire pointed out the main issues for which , in search of answers , it is possible to choose the appropriate way of using a vehicle .
how long can the vehicle be used ?
the greatest difference in car le@@ asing and running is the time for use .
&apos;@@ C@@ le@@ ase it is worth fav@@ ouring the need for a long@@ er@@ -term vehicle , when the company has a plan to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period &apos; , explained the fire , adding that it would be worthwhile to decide in favour of the company if it is to have a vehicle , a full service or a long-term lea@@ f , if a vehicle is to be used perhaps on a day-to-day basis , but leaving the maintenance service with an opt-out on a daily basis .
&apos;@@ R@@ endi@@ ar cars have a much shorter application period than the lif@@ el@@ ine period , but many large large car ren@@ tal companies also offer a long-term wri@@ ter , where the le@@ ase of a car is done without complex contracts and without free return &apos; , they introduced different ways of le@@ asing a car .
who will become the vehicle ow@@ ner ?
at the end of the process , a ren@@ tal car ow@@ ner will be the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ in the case of the distribution of services , at the end of the lif@@ es@@ p@@ an period , it will be possible to carry on with the same or better conditions as li@@ is@@ ta@@ rism , replacing a new vehicle that meets the needs of the company &apos; , by visiting it , stressing that as the consumer society is increasingly moving from service to service average consumption , vehicle ownership of the company is a supplementary duty to the company .
furthermore , in the case of a full service service , the possibility of buying a car on the basis of a desire and agreed conditions is also an option for itself .
however , le@@ is@@ ure is not an option and it is only paid for the period of use .
the mer@@ ging of a car generally takes place in the representa@@ tions of car firms and the le@@ asing of a car from the temporary pool of temporary companies .
while car companies &apos; offices are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles , they also offer the possibility of a journey and , in some cases , also an author@@ ita@@ tive .
however , car companies have the sole aim of le@@ tting them out .
let me tell you that the reasons for the use of ren@@ tal services are different - many companies are le@@ asing their companies , in addition , it is convenient to use the service when they are in the form of for@@ gi@@ veness or holidays , or when their car is in an amendment .
&apos;@@ The head of business vehicles &apos; is increasingly swit@@ ching to full service travel , providing a custom@@ er with transparency of costs , time savings in the purchasing , use and recovery processes of vehicles and greater comfor@@ t &apos; , presented a growing li@@ bel head for sales and marketing .
every year , more and more companies use full service arrangements for their fleet , thereby optimis@@ ing their spending and focusing on their main business .
what is a servi@@ ce@@ -based insurance cover ?
if a li@@ ded car is to be compulsory ca@@ tering and traffic insurance , then the rent car is mostly covered by ba@@ r insurance and , in addition , it has to be decided whether to include , for example , emergency insurance , the@@ ft insurance or full insurance ; &apos; if you compare the plant with the full service club , the custom@@ er receives an equivalent monthly payment , as in addition to the vehicle insurance and the payment of six hours , will also cover the off@@ spring . ty@@ re shif@@ ts and other agreed services &apos; explained the roads .
&apos;@@ whereas in the case of any new vehicle , a full service carri@@ er will be able to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of a company , which will also take into account the functions of the use &apos; , he will be equal to stressing that the full service operation will definitely help opti@@ mise the costs associated with the car fleet of the company .
&apos;@@ The choice of vehicles depends , however , on the tra@@ der car par@@ k - the various rent companies offer both small and econom@@ ical vehicles in their vehicle fleet for urban traffic and the luxury se@@ da@@ r for business meetings &apos; .
of course , in the tight ren@@ ting period , it may happen that the desired car has already been thrown out , but against it it it will contribute to the early boo@@ king of the desired vehicle .
by choosing between mer@@ ging or le@@ asing , the objectives should first be clarified - how long the desire is to use the vehicle and what are long-term plans for the car .
it is certainly worth looking carefully at the different conditions and obligations of services as well .
how one man built a figure of USD 51 million on his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter .
a living father in T@@ ex@@ as found that there were no issues in which the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter of his disability could be played .
he therefore decided to build one for himself .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N had just come out of a boo@@ m on family holidays , when his 12-@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter , Morgan , approached other children playing in water .
he tried to battle with them , but they quickly left the basin .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N thinks that they will lose out because they do not know how to deal with a disabled person - the Morgan has a five-year co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive vision and also a form of a certain au@@ tis@@ m .
this incident left him to be ha@@ unt .
&apos;@@ The body is a young gir@@ l in the ab@@ y@@ ss .
a meeting with him will always bring a laugh@@ ter and he certainly wants to bi@@ te .
however , there have been many times in which we have not been able to place him in different places &apos; he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and her hus@@ band Mag@@ gi@@ e asked others of their parents where they could lead their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters - wherever they feel comfortable and others feel comfortable when they were with them .
&apos;@@ We came to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place &apos; says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he therefore decided in 2007 to build it for itself .
the former real es@@ tate contrac@@ tor sold his house construction companies back in 2005 to set up Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N F@@ oun@@ d@@ y F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ ti@@ on - a non-@@ profit group that would help people with disabilities .
he then started the creation of the &apos; first most accessible area of the world &apos; .
&apos;@@ We wanted to set up a thematic par@@ k where everything can be done where people with special needs and no special needs can play &apos; says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he invited doctors , ste@@ el@@ works , parents and others with disabilities and people without disabilities to consult on the installation .
they were e@@ rec@@ ted in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ ex@@ as .
the par@@ k called Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ land cost USD 34 million ( GBP 26 million ) and opened in 2010 .
these tra@@ cks include perfectly accessible exam@@ in@@ ations , a sam@@ ple playing field and min@@ on@@ g .
visitors to Har@@ t@@ man often say that they only had the opportunity to experience such at@@ ro@@ tations for the first time .
there is a ca@@ rou@@ sel that has me@@ ta@@ ph@@ on@@ ised trans@@ lations specifically for wh@@ eel@@ chairs that move up and below animals .
however , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N points out that the Morgan was afraid of driving at the outset .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we opened , he did not dare to go to that .
he did not understand why this is going around and why the animals go up and go down &apos; says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
it took three years before the Morgan agreed to go to the ca@@ rou@@ sel .
&apos;@@ First he just stood close to that , then he looked at the crea@@ m , but we did not launch the wars .
it was a slow process , but now he lo@@ ves to drive it .
getting over something that frigh@@ tened him meant a lot for him .
the small things achieved by playing are making a big difference &apos; .
since its opening , Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ land has visited more than one million people from 67 countries and 50 of all the American states .
a third of the staff are disabled and entry is free for anyone with a certain condition .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I realised that Morgan was one of the happy , because it has many things that it needs .
I did not want prices to be an obstacle to other people with special needs &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ L@@ et us open every year , knowing that we are going to lose at least one million dollars ( GBP 750 000 ) , and we must back it with the help of the clean@@ ers and partners &apos; .
this year , the subject par@@ k Morgan In@@ spi@@ ra@@ ti@@ on extended with the opening of Iceland , or of a fully accessible water par@@ k .
&apos;@@ in July , fewer people went to the par@@ k because the wh@@ eel@@ chairs became too hot .
so we decided to set aside a water par@@ k , talks H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
in some parts of the island , heat and water has been used to help visitors with meat problems .
there are water@@ tight mobile wh@@ eel@@ chairs available that work with sup@@ pres@@ sive air rather than bat@@ teri@@ es .
it is also possible to travel on the river to a boat .
a total of USD 17 million ( GBP 13 million ) .
&apos;@@ The man In@@ spi@@ ra@@ tive in Iceland came to me and just kept me out &apos; says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ he pointed to his son , who has serious special needs , and he began to complain .
he said that his son had not been able to play in water before &apos; .
according to Har@@ t@@ man &apos;s claim , there are no three par@@ ks of every four visitors with disabilities and the par@@ ks will have exactly the effect he had hoped for .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at helps people understand that , while we are different in certain ways , we are , in fact , exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y saw a gir@@ l in a wh@@ eel@@ chair went to another , without special needs , and they started to play together .
it was a real leap &apos; .
Har@@ t@@ man does not intend to open up any more par@@ ks , even though he has received a mail and hundreds of letters by sea from people who would also like a par@@ k in his neighbour .
instead , it focuses on providing young people with special needs in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ o with educational facilities .
&apos;@@ I know that there are many different organisations trying to build something like M@@ organ@@ s W@@ on@@ der@@ land elsewhere , and we will continue to work with them &apos; , he will add .
it continues to play a role in the Morgan - the body there is now a kind of vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
&apos;@@ I@@ f he comes here , he is like a Swe@@ de !
many people want to talk to him and do a picture with him , they do it well &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
Morgan , which is now 23 years old , can do things better and better .
&apos;@@ he is now talking more , and most of his physical problems have been solved by numerous operations .
we are so proud that he has come so far &apos; .
when Morgan par@@ k visits , it likes to play the most in the ski@@ es and in the s@@ and , without knowing how much it has helped others .
&apos;@@ The body knows that the par@@ k has become his name , but I do not think he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ he does not understand that the way he has handled things in life has made him a real source of inspiration &apos; .
the call to find motor@@ ists in connection with the rape of two girls in W@@ it@@ ton .
the police are trying to find two drivers in connection with investigation into the rape of a 14@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l .
a teen@@ ag@@ raph was attacked in B@@ ir@@ ming@@ ha@@ m in the W@@ it@@ ton region on 26 July at around 2 : 00 ( B@@ S@@ T ) .
before that attack , he was ra@@ ped at the W@@ it@@ ton plant .
in connection with the first case , an accus@@ ation has been made against one man .
the British transport police want to speak as part of the investigation with two motor@@ ists .
according to the police , the first car he@@ d@@ let is the wall .
the inspe@@ c@@ tor , T@@ ony F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , said : &apos; we have grounds to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the plant with a victim before he qu@@ eu@@ ed up and then ra@@ ped the car .
we would like to know what was said in this conver@@ sation ; in addition , the driver may know the important details that would help us in the investigation &apos; .
the driver of the second vehicle , which was , according to the description , red V@@ W S@@ har@@ an , probably brought the victim home after he had been ra@@ ped for a second time .
G@@ en@@ i@@ e , the extra@@ -@@ cancer c@@ at , was known as &apos; ye@@ arly box &apos; .
the rescu@@ ed bo@@ y , who served his or her off@@ en@@ der for th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment , was described as a &apos; ye@@ arly box &apos; .
G@@ en@@ i@@ e was recognised because he con@@ fu@@ sed his ow@@ ner , E@@ vi@@ e H@@ end@@ er@@ son ( 11 ) , six ch@@ emis@@ try .
the E@@ vi@@ e diagno@@ sed a po@@ et cancer in March 201@@ 6 and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e company , he said , helped to cope with a series of painful operations and long time spent in hospital .
the c@@ at was recognised by the Ca@@ ts Pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on in the London ceremony by the ch@@ arity organisation .
the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine : according to E@@ vi@@ e , the c@@ at was behind him when he lost his long bro@@ kers because of ch@@ emis@@ try .
&apos;@@ In my view , he is the best .
he deserves that .
he has always existed for me &apos; , said E@@ vi@@ e .
&apos;@@ he came to my stone j@@ al@@ k and he sat next to my feet .
he tr@@ usted the pi@@ g and the fa@@ ke in a di@@ am@@ en to sin@@ k my s@@ on@@ g@@ s on my b@@ reat@@ h .
when I was too sick to be able to visit friends or to go out , and I had to sit at home , he came to me and it changed me much more jo@@ y , offering a great deal of con@@ sol@@ ation .
according to E@@ vi@@ e , he has a special link with his fav@@ ou@@ rite crea@@ m , which was of huge support for him when he lost his ha@@ ir because of cu@@ ri@@ o@@ rous treatment .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at left me very out because I had long bro@@ wn ha@@ irs .
however , because the par@@ k was sh@@ ou@@ ting , the G@@ en@@ i@@ e was similarly harsh and the fact that I lost my ha@@ ir and G@@ en@@ i@@ e himself was a little miti@@ gated by the whole shock .
E@@ vi@@ e Fa@@ ther Ch@@ ris H@@ end@@ er@@ son said that the ca@@ ke has been a &apos; great dis@@ si@@ d@@ ent &apos; and he described how E@@ vi@@ e &apos; had the ha@@ bit of looking at his lo@@ ved pe@@ ts in the hospital bed .
&apos;@@ E@@ vi@@ e was in hospital for more than 300 days , so we spent a lot of time there , and that offered him something to expect if he got home for some valuable days &apos; .
a 1@@ 1-@@ year-old word : &apos; I wanted him every day when I was in hospital , and my family said that he is looking at me as well .
he is my best friend and I really do not know what I will do without him .
the group will urge the government to agree on transitional conditions in Bre@@ x@@ t .
one of the largest groups of business lobbyists in Britain is urging the government to stop dan@@ cing around the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery of Bre@@ x@@ ti .
In@@ sti@@ tes of Di@@ re@@ c@@ tor@@ s ( I@@ o@@ D ) called on the government to come up with a request for a &apos; transitional agreement &apos; in order to make the Bre@@ x dynamic .
it wants the government to create the &apos; Bre@@ x@@ t gap &apos; between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements .
the group warned that , without such an agreement , business activity would face &apos; short-term cha@@ otic cal@@ cal@@ ori@@ e fluctu@@ ations &apos; .
they criticised the government for &apos; transfer &apos; to all kinds of speculative disputes &apos; .
in recent weeks , the members of the government have put forward conflicting views on how long the transitional period will last and what it will bring .
the I@@ o@@ D report entitled &apos; Bu@@ il@@ ding the Bre@@ x@@ t divide - options for transition &apos; says : &apos; instead of running the problem far away , the government must provo@@ ke a strategic debate on this issue .
this could minimise the increasing confusion and uncertainty in this area &apos; .
however , this week , Ger@@ ard Ly@@ on , econom@@ ist and group E@@ con@@ om@@ is@@ ts for Bre@@ x , expressed concern about the &apos; volati@@ le Bre@@ x@@ ti &apos; Bre@@ x@@ t as &apos; pan@@ ic pan@@ ac@@ ea &apos; , which rese@@ m@@ bles the exchange of fear of Y@@ K &apos;s computer programming error on the M@@ DGs .
Mr Ham@@ mon@@ d warned in June : &apos; there is a large number of commercial investments to be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is &apos; .
Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ is@@ on , I@@ o@@ D E@@ L@@ -@@ EU and Trade Policy leader said , &apos; C@@ an@@ ts@@ le@@ l is entitled to worry about the pro@@ cras@@ tin@@ ation of business investment .
this is one of the most commonly viewed changes that need to be addressed in connection with Bre@@ x@@ on , alongside the relocation of operations to the EU .
the latter applies especially to I@@ o@@ D members in Northern Ireland , who are currently considering co-@@ location or relocation &apos; .
the I@@ o@@ D proposes several options , including the following : the extension of the Article 50 agreement from March 201@@ 9 .
accession to the European Economic Area
agreement to remain beyond the scope of EU legislation .
the creation of a transitional customs agreement , in the same way as the EU customs union .
Ren@@ is@@ on said : &apos; I@@ o@@ D proposed these opportunities in relation to the transition , hoping that it will spar@@ k a proper debate on how best to bring Bre@@ x to a conclusion .
priorit@@ ising interim arrangements and thereby allevi@@ ating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term cha@@ otic volatility will not dimin@@ ish future opportunities &apos; .
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an species are at risk .
professional sport stands at a cross@@ roads in Australia : some areas have mig@@ rated on a corporate path so far that they are too business centres to classi@@ fy sport ;
others are returning to the ama@@ te@@ ur world , which is too sport to be regarded as a business .
this confusion is demonstrated by the painful delays from C@@ ric@@ k A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia ( ca ) in obtaining a wage settlement with players , the un@@ determined dis@@ mis@@ sal of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Union ( debate ) , the up@@ rising of the stakeholders in Australia &apos;s football f@@ ed@@ a ( ff@@ a ) , the rus@@ hing together of an independent commission that is too workable , and the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an F@@ A@@ L to be in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent among the people and their flag for social justice .
the Investment Bank and John W@@ y@@ li@@ e , Chair of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Committee on S@@ port , have endeav@@ oured to push the Olympic campaign actively along the same lines as professional oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions , placing business@@ men at the top positions who have no elite experience in sport .
the con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy gi@@ ant Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to@@ t , who has a reputation for deplo@@ ying tac@@ tics by trade unions , was seen as a troika in the problems of having A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cri@@ p@@ pling players &apos; agreement with the Union ( AC@@ A ) .
David Pe@@ e@@ ver is the former executive director of Ri@@ o tin@@ to A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia and is working to help the CA@@ R in pay negotiations by the leader and advi@@ ser .
it would be a mistake , however , to think that the elite business@@ men , whose approach is un@@ man@@ age@@ able in communic@@ ating with criminal players , do not love it as a sport .
Pe@@ e@@ ver , for example , was a regular vis@@ or for the poultry games of the S@@ tor@@ ia when he bought another state .
nevertheless , tough negotiations between S@@ ca and AC@@ A and extremely high wages have given the impression that the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an ski@@ pp@@ ine reference now belongs more to business than to sports .
in contrast , the inability of Mr Cam@@ er@@ on C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , the former CE@@ O of the Naz@@ i , to ex@@ pel the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ by team has pushed back too much to its roots .
the people of the Southern Union now prefer to enter the sta@@ di@@ um of the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery in order to look at the game between ama@@ te@@ ur cre@@ ws , while at the same time pl@@ undering the be@@ er and the innocent ha@@ y@@ e do@@ g &apos; .
R@@ ag@@ bi@@ li@@ er bo@@ ar@@ ns that they have the most qualified and most diverse management in Australia , but too failure to meet the requirements of international partners shows that it is still too much sport to be business .
both arms and football have problems with management , because the stakeholders are demanding more power .
both too chair@@ men , John G@@ ran@@ t AR@@ L@@ C and Ste@@ ven L@@ ow@@ w@@ y ff@@ e@@ e , have shown that their commercial skills have not been sufficient to achieve corpor@@ al stability .
G@@ ran@@ t , former K@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o , was led by a successful IT undertaking , but for 20 years it was completely out of the game .
it became a value when the newly formed AR@@ L@@ C needed an independent presidency .
the far too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one who has been involved in the work of the Commission in the ra@@ g@@ by species in any way over the last three years , with the exception of a passive phenomenon .
however , the p@@ ounds s@@ and too far on the business side and the f@@ ans have been looking for a sa@@ vi@@ our from that time - someone with a distinguished past in sport .
the Chair of the CE@@ O of West@@ ph@@ ile Foreign Investment , L@@ ow@@ w@@ y quite ff@@ a , from his father Fran@@ k , from one A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an to the rich@@ est .
the &apos; too many club@@ s &apos; wish to be better represented in Congress , which is elected by the Bureau .
their owners lose their money , but they believe they are as worthy as Man@@ ch@@ ester Uni@@ tes .
iron@@ ically , the sports and business ethics h@@ eral@@ ds F@@ IF@@ A amb@@ assa@@ dors to end the civil war in sport .
A@@ FL@@ -@@ on has its own ties with Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to , recently , the President-in-Office of the Council , M@@ ike F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , and A@@ FL@@ -@@ i former Commissioner Ch@@ ris L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , the Ex@@ c@@ ker of extraction .
it is all too proud to take on the role of national leader in promoting gender equality , activities relating to inher@@ it@@ ance and refugees and gay rights .
some cy@@ n@@ ics could imply that this would be done in government aid funds in the milk .
by taking up the post of F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , the President of A@@ FL@@ -@@ i , Richard Go@@ der , said : &apos; A@@ F@@ L is more than a business , given how it assis@@ ts all these communities &apos; .
Go@@ y@@ der will soon be the out@@ going executive director and the first chair@@ man@@ ship of A@@ FL@@ -@@ FL@@ -@@ for not playing at an elite level .
the former W@@ es@@ far@@ mer President , Bo@@ b E@@ ver@@ y , is on the board of C@@ ric@@ ke A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia .
the guiding threa@@ d of the appointment of members of professional sports directors is often the priority of independence over competence .
in the rush to recru@@ it the business people , they have forgotten something that could be called incitement to ad@@ minister and a b@@ ric@@ k against sport .
what is more , many corporate heav@@ y@@ we@@ ights are not used to intensive , and sometimes also critical , monitoring of the media on a personal level .
something that works in a corporate world may not trans@@ c@@ end the area of sport .
the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian Court imposed a life@@ time sentence on the killing of three US military personnel .
the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian military appeal court imposed a life sentence on the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian sol@@ di@@ er last year for the ru@@ in of three US military teachers .
last month , the Chi@@ ef Court of Justice imposed an old Fran@@ k al-@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ ale access to the American aviation base for the slaughter of the Americans during their life@@ time imprisonment , together with hard work .
Al@@ -@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a opened fire on the Americans &apos; car@@ pet , claiming that he was afraid of an attack on the base .
however , the video of a security cam@@ era published after the decision showed that he continued the shoo@@ ting even when two Americans st@@ ole@@ n and shot with orders to stop the shoo@@ ting .
U@@ u@@ dis@@ te@@ sa@@ i hal@@ a A@@ k@@ h@@ ba@@ r , linked to the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian army , announced on Thursday that the military appeal court with five judges confirmed the punishment of al-@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a .
Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ one takes up , in a hospi@@ tality fashion , the &apos; O@@ ur life &apos; in the second season .
the Ju@@ h@@ ti@@ v@@ producer , D@@ an F@@ og@@ el@@ man , on Thursday in the C@@ ri@@ ti@@ com Association Forum , announced that the N@@ B@@ C &apos;s forthcoming second season will be brought up by Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ one .
as a actor , K@@ ey@@ v@@ in ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Har@@ tle@@ y ) takes on board the fil@@ ms at the start of the season .
&apos;@@ K@@ e@@ v@@ in plays a major film and we needed a great deal of con@@ no@@ tations &apos; , said F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
at the end of the last season , K@@ e@@ v@@ in was stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly re@@ m@@ un@@ erated of the important role played by the s@@ om@@ e@@ time R@@ on Ho@@ war@@ di film .
at this time , we will see how the project is involved and , at the same time , it war@@ ns up relations with its own mistake , which Alex@@ and@@ ra B@@ re@@ c@@ k@@ en@@ ri@@ dge is playing .
according to F@@ og@@ el@@ man , Sta@@ l@@ one &apos; film in which K@@ e@@ v@@ in atten@@ ds plays a is@@ ph@@ ig@@ hu@@ r &apos; .
&apos;@@ The sta@@ r of our life &apos; , Mil@@ o V@@ enti@@ mig@@ lia , who plays father in K@@ har@@ tou@@ y &apos;s images of the past , was a coincidence in the 2006 film &apos; Ro@@ ck@@ y Bal@@ bo@@ a &apos; Sta@@ l@@ one &apos; son .
F@@ og@@ el@@ man said that V@@ enti@@ mig@@ lia still had a thri@@ ving friendship with Sta@@ l@@ one , it was probably the one that helped to attract a couple of years as a col@@ os@@ sal player .
&apos;@@ We have an excellent scenario for him .
I believe that it will be truly exc@@ iting , called F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
&apos;@@ our lives &apos; will return to te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es on 26 September .
J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on sp@@ ends about 300 000 dollars a year to keep his body in play .
every N@@ FL@@ -@@ i player depends on their own body to earn a living .
therefore , many other bat@@ tles are also investing a lot of money in poor care and reconstruction in order to stay in the form of excellence .
the Y@@ e@@ re@@ my Fo@@ w@@ ler portal ES@@ P@@ N@@ .@@ com looked into how far some ve@@ ter@@ ans are prepared to go in order to extend their career .
however , no case is so extreme than that of the 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , a player on the f@@ las@@ h S@@ te@@ le@@ r@@ si defen@@ sive line for the 14@@ th season .
according to the F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler , Har@@ ris@@ on sp@@ ends USD 300 000 a year in average for coun@@ ty treatment , mass depor@@ tations , fib@@ re practices and pu@@ mp@@ s .
most of the costs are linked to public travel to meet specialists .
&apos;@@ I do not need to keep a record on such things &apos; , said Har@@ ris@@ on .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you compare the sums that you have earned with my expenditure , the payments are worth it , given the way I feel &apos; .
M@@ ike Mitchell , Har@@ ris@@ on training partner and cre@@ w in S@@ te@@ le@@ r@@ s , estimated the annual amount of USD 200 000 to look after their bodies .
a 3@@ 0-@@ year-old Mitchell has put in place a rela@@ xation ( in English , &apos; bo@@ dy te@@ m@@ per@@ ing &apos; ) , which the F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler described as &apos; the use of the 55 k@@ g me@@ tal as a mas@@ sa@@ ach@@ ine &apos; .
&apos;@@ A@@ ll rol@@ ls on it &apos; , Mr Mitchell said , rather than taking pat@@ ron@@ age &apos; .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the ski@@ es have a place on their feet and they begin to move around this matter , it is , at times , painful .
but if you stand up , the tension has immediately disappeared .
it is just thro@@ wing out the tension &apos; .
they are ready to make additional efforts , but former N@@ FL@@ -@@ i players , Bar@@ ry Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d and R@@ y@@ an Harkin , spend on average 50 000 dollars a year on recovery .
Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d , who played 10 times in the ran@@ ks of New York Gi@@ an@@ ts and Washington Reding , has expressed regret that he did not spend any more .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I could go back , I would invest more &apos; , Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d F@@ ow@@ ler said .
&apos;@@ I would probably spend at least twice as much .
I was at a very good health for the first eight years of my career .
in the end , perhaps more procedures would have been helpful .
R@@ y@@ an Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a promo@@ ter of a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old back defence line , expressed a readiness to follow in the foot@@ steps of his ve@@ ter@@ ans S@@ te@@ les team .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you pay a USD 100 000 and earn an extra three million while playing , that decision is quite simple &apos; , Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er said .
as far as the long term is concerned , investing in the recovery of players is much more intelligent than spending money on cars and cotton .
the average N@@ FL@@ -@@ i player is lu@@ cky to be able to play longer than 30 years of life , all the more so as the success of Har@@ ris@@ on should persuade his colleagues to direct their spending on the other .
but perhaps they can just find some local specialists .
how prin@@ ted Di@@ ana used her me@@ al as a weapon .
when I think of the pa@@ ro@@ ch@@ ial Di@@ ana , the first thing to do is to look ahead to the hypo@@ the@@ tical .
a da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Sin@@ ti in the younger age .
afterwards , his black s@@ lan@@ der in the &apos; Pan@@ or@@ am@@ a &apos; inter@@ view of his Martin B@@ ash@@ ir , the effect of which was devastating when he looked through the wh@@ eel@@ s , c@@ iting an un@@ dying phrase : &apos; we were three in this hel@@ ple@@ ss , so it was a little bit too big &apos; .
the big eyes and the eyes that were surroun@@ ded by his mis@@ gi@@ vings , the th@@ ick in the face , left him with the impression of an open animal .
that is what he has tried to achieve .
outside the public , however , pr@@ in@@ a@@ u Di@@ ana never performed much on a me@@ al , at least not according to modern standards .
it was not just that he did not need it - he was beautiful , of course - but he saw a typical commitment , something that is related to work rather than some .
in public , he was able to wear a wh@@ is@@ ky la@@ yer .
once he arrived in the offices of the Con@@ de N@@ da , V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos;s publis@@ hers , we@@ aring a pac@@ k , almost an or@@ an@@ ge che@@ ering la@@ yer .
he a@@ po@@ log@@ ised to say that his sk@@ in has to s@@ mi@@ le from the sun as if he went out &apos; usually &apos; , then di@@ r@@ ty photo@@ graph@@ s would photo@@ g@@ rap@@ ple him and then put all the charges to show that he sees &apos; no less &apos; , &apos; ash &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; .
it is for this very reason that Di@@ ana went at an insult three times a week , using a machine that is present at home .
today , it would , of course , be counterproductive for health reasons , but it was a useful objective for Di@@ ana , which enabled it to show the world its spiri@@ tual character , even though its internal black cl@@ ou@@ ds and s@@ on@@ g@@ s were filled .
probably one of the greatest mistakes of the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily was to think that , if they pra@@ y her as hus@@ band of C@@ har@@ les , they would be able to obtain one small mar@@ ty@@ r for themselves , who would only have sugar be@@ et at times .
the reality was exactly the opposite .
he may not have been the best class at school , but when it came to creating an image , he was a complete student .
for Di@@ ana , the importance of so@@ ya and Me@@ at was that they could be used to communicate tuna or hours .
otherwise they did not offer him the slightest interest .
his friend , R@@ os@@ a Mon@@ ck@@ ton - Di@@ ana was the mother of his youn@@ gest child - re@@ members that we were not something they used to speak about .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k just &apos; , he said , &apos; how much relief he felt on these occasions when we went together in a k@@ ir@@ ker and did not think &apos; .
today we tend to think of a man as something that improves the chances of a woman , but it is clear that when you look back at the H@@ y@@ e C@@ up , she used this powerful P@@ R tool .
the moments when he felt most freely were his own most , are the moments when he was also the most natural of all , bearing very little on earth .
in 199@@ 3 , with his two young bo@@ ys in T@@ hor@@ pe &apos;s par@@ g , lo@@ g@@ ers Le@@ appal@@ i , he was a stepping stone and a laugh@@ ter from the heart , a vicious che@@ que dis@@ per@@ sed under the eyes of a little like any mother who sp@@ ends a day with children .
four months after he and C@@ har@@ les had been announced that he had left , he had finally pic@@ ked up the dist@@ ress and &apos; normal &apos; .
or , in recent years , by tru@@ mp@@ ing out of a tra@@ in@@ er , a ha@@ ir set up in a form of bic@@ y@@ cle kil@@ ls , a face being pu@@ mped from a tra@@ in@@ e , health and life is getting away from every side of his journey .
in the end of his life , when he started to assert his independence and his self-@@ confidence gre@@ w , we saw more and more such a Di@@ ana .
he coherent himself with H@@ al@@ o T@@ r@@ ust and wal@@ ked through Ang@@ ol@@ a min@@ e@@ field in January 1997 .
at that time , at the age of 35 , the Jewish sof@@ tw@@ are and natural , a face almost exclusively without a man , he probably saw the cam@@ era as ever , re@@ minis@@ cent of this sh@@ ining and hopeful young gir@@ l who laugh@@ ed at the bet@@ ting shop of 15 years ago .
Di@@ ana was just about to reach its best years .
in the early times , a young Di@@ ana S@@ pen@@ c@@ eri@@ l had a dream of R@@ a@@ ff@@ ae@@ lic .
however , it did not go long until &apos; dec@@ ar@@ bon@@ isation &apos; started , a process that was mainly di@@ ri@@ fied by the blind and pal@@ e to make a young ne@@ u@@ u re@@ fin@@ ed from Di@@ an@@ as , who would be worth their new state .
in part , it involved the cra@@ ck@@ down on C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ ward , a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ ist man , who L@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ on often used photo@@ graph@@ s .
Ho@@ w@@ ard met with a fe@@ ar@@ ful Di@@ an@@ ga for the first time in S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ oni K@@ en@@ sin@@ ton , in order to record the official la@@ yer of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine for V@@ o@@ gu@@ e .
at that point , at the end of the 1980s , Di@@ ana was still a blan@@ k che@@ que .
his most fine beau@@ ty products came from T@@ he Bo@@ dy S@@ h@@ op@@ ing , for example El@@ der@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ er in his eye .
Ho@@ w@@ ard made use of Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor@@ i &apos;s ju@@ mb@@ o cre@@ i S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us , H@@ one@@ y Tou@@ ch and Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor@@ i &apos;s con@@ d@@ ol@@ ent , F@@ ro@@ s@@ al C@@ or@@ al .
he gave the E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den to@@ one R@@ ice and Tim@@ ber@@ l@@ and and the gol@@ den white bul@@ let table .
from that discretion , E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den was enhanced by ri@@ ps@@ tic@@ hu@@ ch and the blue con@@ cer@@ t .
and we know all this because Ho@@ w@@ ard created a model for him .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana &apos;s eyes are so mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous that I wanted to stress their striking blue &apos; , he wrote later .
the final result , however , is not particularly attractive for such a young gir@@ l , which looks like an 18-@@ year-old woman , who is becoming 50 years old .
he is too op@@ pres@@ sive and too much b@@ older bro@@ wn on his eyes .
the most striking thing here , however , is the no@@ tori@@ ous bridge bridge bridge ser@@ ver in this ton@@ ty D@@ is@@ ne@@ y pr@@ in@@ ta@@ s in the blue .
the reference to fan@@ tas@@ y .
it is not surprising , then , why Di@@ ana is looking towards us with a little uncertainty .
one of the sources of Di@@ ana &apos;s po@@ lar@@ isation was the fact that she never knew where the public per@@ version would end and starts with privacy .
that was the start of this process .
the person most probably affected by this meeting was M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l , who still plays an important role in the contemporary world .
a Me@@ ig@@ u@@ tist , who is currently among others since C@@ han@@ el , is still one of the grou@@ p@@ ings of the Muslim world .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an@@ al had an incredibly beautiful sk@@ in and long inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bility &apos; , rese@@ m@@ bles it .
&apos;@@ he was just a mag@@ nific@@ ent .
he was God by the men .
he was sex without he trying to do so &apos; .
Di@@ ana met Di@@ ana for the first time in 199@@ 1 , when V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos;s then pe@@ as@@ tic Anna Har@@ ve@@ y asked him to make a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine of the most estimated photo@@ graph@@ s with Cap@@ k Pat@@ ric@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ er , before December .
the gentle@@ man S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t also bel@@ on@@ ged to the team .
this happened when Mrs Di@@ ana and Mr Char@@ le@@ si &apos;s a@@ th@@ le@@ tes were the greatest and , in the name of public support , the se@@ ces@@ sion started .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , they did not tell us who is , although we knew that it was someone who was a very famous &apos; , Mr Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l said .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we arrived , Di@@ ana was just standing there , was friendly and extremely anxious that it could be on the front of V@@ o@@ gu@@ e i &apos; .
this insi@@ di@@ ous picture - Di@@ ana simplified k@@ am@@ p@@ sun@@ a , a k@@ ir@@ n@@ g@@ l ra@@ ging , its private eyes , its cy@@ an@@ tic French man@@ ik@@ a@@ u , its ha@@ ir of the short cut - was pi@@ ec@@ e@@ me@@ al .
it was rus@@ hed by the posi@@ tives , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and ec@@ leg@@ an@@ ts .
above all , it was modern , conve@@ ying a minim@@ alist a@@ es@@ thetic to early n@@ ine@@ ties and creating a strong contrast between Di@@ ana and the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily , who faced the &apos; do@@ se hor@@ ri@@ bi@@ lis &apos; , as the Qu@@ e@@ en mentioned later .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana was very open to her own country .
he simply wanted to see a fresh and different &apos; , said G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ l .
over time , he taught Di@@ an@@ at himself to take the lead - a cre@@ do , a che@@ ese cre@@ do , a be@@ et to raise the eyes , a ri@@ ps@@ chi@@ ch - and he emphasised a healthy sk@@ in care , encouraging him to take good care of himself and to follow the man@@ tra &apos; internal beau@@ ty &apos; .
Di@@ ana &apos; has done everything in moder@@ ation &apos; says Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
he bu@@ ried enough and reduced the consumption of alcohol , which is very important for sk@@ in with fresh expression .
P@@ rin@@ ce preferred the Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in che@@ qu@@ er , C@@ lar@@ in@@ si h@@ lep@@ hon@@ y and Clin@@ ique i Wil@@ d Ro@@ se .
but the biggest service M@@ ary Di@@ ana did was to ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate her from your bridge .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at simply made him so much older &apos; , he said .
instead , he used a combination of soft bro@@ thers and neutral ton@@ es , along with the bro@@ wn ju@@ ri@@ di@@ cal line , which had been bu@@ ried among themselves , so all the ser@@ ts were fairly soft .
he often just used the cre@@ w at that time and a little sun@@ sh@@ ine to highlight Di@@ ana &apos;s whole@@ some .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an@@ al used to call me and invite me to discuss the products that I liked to do so &apos; , G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ l told me .
&apos;@@ I think it was enter@@ prising for him ; the opportunity to take a few moments for himself &apos; .
his fav@@ ou@@ rite was the luxury br@@ and C@@ lar@@ in .
Di@@ ana has allegedly used the da@@ y@@ light and night cre@@ w for their sensitive sk@@ in and their Al@@ p@@ ine plants for clean@@ ing milk and tone .
he also went to Jan@@ et F@@ il@@ der@@ man in the Central London Gu@@ ard on a regular basis .
Di@@ an@@ al had a famous beautiful sk@@ in , but sometimes it had ro@@ em@@ ents , moderate din@@ o@@ sa@@ ge , which is often due to stress .
in order to mitigate this , he used natural stra@@ its , including bit@@ ter oil .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an@@ al had an excellent luxury structure &apos; , said G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
the only part of his appearance , which he was very un@@ sure about , was his no@@ se .
an@@ ger K@@ har@@ y rec@@ alls : &apos; once the newspapers wrote that he had travelled to N@@ in@@ a@@ ga in a beau@@ ty operation , he ap@@ pealed to me and said , &apos; frankly , if I had allowed my no@@ se to bur@@ y , would you s@@ mi@@ le so that I had chosen it ? &apos;
when the advice of M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t started sitting , Di@@ ana felt more and more confident about her new appearance .
one of his most ple@@ asing public statements - in 1994 in the Ser@@ pen@@ tine &apos; gallery in London , where he attached the famous &apos; re@@ tali@@ atory bro@@ ke@@ red &apos; , ex@@ pe@@ l@@ ling a f@@ ig@@ hu@@ r op@@ pressed on the shoulder from Chris@@ tina Sta@@ mb@@ an@@ na - shows that he began to turn up his life in the final signals of the years .
with short and over@@ lo@@ aded talks , Di@@ ana is both sex@@ ist and dynamic , her brief so@@ en@@ g was in sharp contrast with a very challenging black si@@ e@@ ge .
his men@@ tality is perfect - lu@@ cra@@ tive but , at the same time , modest , black me@@ al in under@@ lining his eye .
the d@@ res@@ sed col@@ ours , particularly the red ones , were fed into the in@@ fin@@ ite tu@@ m@@ ours of k@@ et@@ tle , quite probably to Re@@ v@@ l@@ on , which then in some respects became a trade@@ mark .
a few months later , he avoided his e@@ leg@@ ant red man@@ i@@ fold in the k@@ it@@ che@@ n of the Fund in the Kingdom of Justice .
pa@@ per@@ work was a benchmark for health and self-@@ confidence .
last but not least , he has full control .
in the days and in his form , his me@@ th@@ ick , he conve@@ ys exactly what he wants to think : there is a woman who seems to have at last a suicide and a purpose in life and who has finally , having received just 36 of his seats .
it is a real pity that he was unable to prove it to himself .
IA@@ A@@ F war@@ ns that petitions will be closely monitored in the London World C@@ up .
on Friday , the K@@ er@@ ge@@ m World C@@ up will start in London and a@@ th@@ le@@ tes will be more ram@@ pan@@ t in relation to d@@ oping channels than ever .
these World C@@ up are the first to be dominated by a new body , a@@ th@@ le@@ tic Integ@@ ration Un@@ it ( A@@ I@@ U ) , which also monit@@ ors corruption , gambling and the falsi@@ fication of results .
&apos;@@ cannot be ruled out that people &apos;s crea@@ tiveness does not allow such things to happen .
we can say , however , that we have the best practices and the best anti-@@ d@@ oping programme , which can now be on the basis of information and data collection , and we will see the result after the event &apos; , David Ho@@ w@@ man , the A@@ I@@ U representative said .
A@@ I@@ U has allowed 19 a@@ th@@ le@@ tes of approximately 19@@ 0 Russian a@@ th@@ le@@ tes to compete as neutral a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
le@@ tting the tru@@ mp@@ s of trans@@ cri@@ pp@@ ers is probably a federal crime , according to former prosecu@@ tors .
he who le@@ ak@@ ed the bul@@ bs on the press between President tru@@ mp@@ s and foreign leaders probably committed a crime , stated the former prosecu@@ tors on Thursday when the legislators called for the extradition of the def@@ end@@ ant .
&apos;@@ The un@@ authorised disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime &apos; , said the former Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor of C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia , Jo@@ e G@@ en@@ o@@ va F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws .
these various acts involving the disclosure of notes of conver@@ sa@@ tions between President and foreign leaders and their trans@@ cri@@ ptions pose a serious threat to national security .
on the basis of the documents le@@ ak@@ ed by the Washington Po@@ st , the new te@@ m@@ pered speeches made on Thursday at the end of January by the President of Mexico En@@ ri@@ que P@@ EN@@ A N@@ ie@@ to and the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Prime Minister , Mal@@ col@@ n@@ bul@@ l .
in the first place , the head of the Mexic@@ an Head of State allegedly ordered an end to the public pro@@ clam@@ ation that his government would not pay for the border wall .
according to the newspapers , trans@@ cri@@ pp@@ ers included notes indicating that they have been secre@@ ted by the President of the National Security Council .
the Po@@ st said that they were reached by the integrated trans@@ cri@@ pp@@ ers &apos; put together by the Val@@ ge Ma@@ ja Workers &apos; and based on the newspaper Ma@@ ge ma@@ ke@@ ear@@ ners &apos; publis@@ hers .
&apos;@@ There is a f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist rule that makes such dis@@ su@@ a@@ sive information to an un@@ authorised person le@@ as@@ hing a crime , a federal crime &apos; , the former public prosecu@@ tor in New York , D@@ ou@@ g Bur@@ ns , said a telephone inter@@ view .
although some of the details of these speeches came before the public in February , the disclosure of trans@@ cri@@ ptions marks a much greater blow to Val@@ ge@@ le M@@ Ã¶@@ l , who is trying to reduce le@@ aks .
the report was rand@@ om@@ ly published at a time when senior figures from the tru@@ mp@@ ing administration were preparing vigorous public action on Friday to show their commitment to the eradication of classified information le@@ af@@ le@@ ts .
the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor , J@@ ef@@ f S@@ es@@ sion@@ s , the National In@@ tel@@ ligence Director , D@@ an Co@@ at@@ si , General R@@ o@@ o Ro@@ sen@@ stein , and the head of the National Res@@ pon@@ se Centre for Security , Wil@@ li@@ am E@@ van@@ in@@ at , is expected to famili@@ arise the public with the situation in the headquarters of the Ministry of Justice .
it is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice will look at the T@@ he Po@@ ts lea@@ k .
in order for anyone to be held to account , according to Bur@@ ns , &apos; certain elements must be clearly demonstrated &apos; .
he said &apos; there could be some mis@@ carri@@ ages on this subject &apos; , referring to the investigation of H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton ema@@ ils by the former Secretary of State and the decision not to lo@@ dge an accus@@ ation .
these considerations include document labels and history and its precise classification .
in the event of secrecy , the public prosecu@@ tors will examine whether the document was le@@ ak@@ ed to an un@@ authorised person in a way that nega@@ tively affects the interests of the United States .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen all this can be verified , people can undoubtedly be in a crimin@@ ally defence@@ less situation &apos; , Bur@@ ns said .
&apos;@@ There is no doubt &apos; .
when it comes to the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ters of tru@@ mp@@ s , di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was the public prosecu@@ tor of sp@@ ying cases , said that such documents were &apos; usually clas@@ sed as secret and higher &apos; .
by claiming that these sp@@ il@@ ls threaten the ability of the United States Government to conduct foreign policy , the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor of Di@@ di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va ap@@ pealed to con@@ vene a federal , criminal coun@@ cil of senior men in order to find le@@ ad@@ ers .
he also said that , in order to obtain the lists of T@@ he Po@@ st re@@ por@@ ters and ed@@ it@@ orial telephone calls , a legal order should be put forward - something that re@@ por@@ ters would undoubtedly protest against .
U@@ TA@@ H , Re@@ publi@@ can Sen@@ ator M@@ ike Le@@ e , said on Thursday , C@@ ap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill , that there should be a criminal procedure for dete@@ cting classified information .
&apos;@@ The person who le@@ ak@@ ed them - he must be punished and , in addition , he must be dis@@ missed &apos; said in Le@@ e F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a &apos; Ne@@ ws H@@ Q &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is unacceptable and should never happen &apos; .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before being elected in the Senate in 2010 , said that this leakage is a &apos; crime &apos; , a very serious federal crime &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at should not and should not be accompanied only by dis@@ mis@@ sal , but also by criminal proceedings , given that information has been classified &apos; , without war .
it has been said to Mr Ne@@ ws that at this stage , Friday announ@@ cements from the Ministry of Justice could , rather , give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , rather than clarifying certain procedures .
last week President S@@ es@@ sion@@ ers criticised his an@@ ger publicly at the chief prosecu@@ tor , claiming that the latter has not made sufficient efforts to find the le@@ as@@ hers .
&apos;@@ I want the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor to be much more severe about the le@@ aks coming from the security agencies &apos; , said the tru@@ m@@ p on 25 July in ro@@ si@@ ai@@ a .
last week in S@@ es@@ si@@ ons himself admitted to F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws Tun@@ c@@ ker Car@@ l@@ son that he was not satisfied with the efforts made to study the President has been repeatedly putting obstacles to his in@@ audi@@ ence .
&apos;@@ I was not happy with the criminal le@@ aks in the past and in the investigations &apos; , said in se@@ s@@ ons .
even some people critical of the President have spoken out against the le@@ aks , saying that this practice is detrimental to foreign policy efforts .
&apos;@@ The bro@@ ac@@ hing of a speech between the President and the leader of the outside country is outrageous , shocking and dangerous &apos; , wrote David f@@ ru@@ m on Thursday in at@@ lan@@ tic@@ ity .
&apos;@@ It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidenti@@ ally - and perhaps even more importantly - for foreign leaders to understand that they can respond confidenti@@ ally &apos; .
Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner ( D@@ -@@ V@@ a ) , the leader of the Senate Security Committee , also said to T@@ he Da@@ il@@ y B@@ ear@@ t that the le@@ aks are &apos; absolutely &apos; worrying &apos; and the Congress should study it .
an American na@@ val carri@@ er is ordered to remove from the post box in the surroun@@ dings dep@@ ic@@ ted by the American flag .
Er@@ us , between the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an and the Union of the hom@@ e-@@ owners of the United States and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , is at the heart of the dispute over the post covered by the American flag .
the Er@@ us Na@@ vy officer , John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , says that he received a letter last week from the Civil Soci@@ ety of S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood , asking him to remove or face penalties from the post office of the state flag .
he said to the W@@ C@@ T@@ V@@ s that he did not intend to give up without a fight and has made an appeal .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me view it frankly as bit@@ ter &apos; , said A@@ ck@@ er@@ t .
and I think people should fight to be harder in whatever form , particularly with their com@@ mu@@ te .
Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that the Union of hom@@ e-@@ holders says that it is not in line with the a@@ es@@ thetic values of S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood .
the US na@@ vy in the war of John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t ordered him to remove his post office in an area imag@@ ining an American flag .
as a result of the approach to the end of the Christmas season , we ask you to remove the letter from the post office in the surrounding the American flag .
for@@ m@@ ul@@ as can be outside 30 days and must be withdrawn within 15 days at the latest .
he said that there have been four years outside the surroun@@ dings .
it got it there 30 days after the building was relo@@ cated .
messages to the S@@ ou@@ th@@ wood housing union did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning .
some of the neighbours of A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said to the W@@ C@@ T@@ V@@ s that the letter was a little harsh , and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Union of hom@@ el@@ ands .
&apos;@@ M@@ ike Ste@@ p@@ h@@ en@@ son said it all the time &apos; .
I think that is ridiculous .
why should it not be patri@@ otic in their own countries ?
M@@ ike P@@ A@@ T@@ EL said : &apos; it is a ve@@ ter@@ an who served our country .
that is just a flag in the after@@ ma@@ th .
I do not think that is right .
the house belongs to it , at least that could be allowed .
a letter from the Union of Civil Pro@@ duct states that A@@ ck@@ er@@ t has 15 days to remove it , otherwise he will be faced with a fine .
he has not received an answer to his appeal .

report : Mu@@ el@@ ler called for a total of senior men to be studied in connection with Russia .
the Wall S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal announced on Thursday that Russia and Don@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp@@ i presidential campaign , a special prosecu@@ tor investigating possible links , has conven@@ ed a group of senior men .
the letter states that the House of L@@ at@@ in@@ ers has a new and significant improvement in the investigation carried out by the Special Pro@@ secu@@ tor , Robert Mu@@ el@@ ler , as to whether the tru@@ m@@ p , or his main advi@@ sers , held a secret campaign to promote the presidential campaign in the Republic of 201@@ 6 with Moscow .
the N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws have announced in the past that before Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler , the former director of the F@@ B@@ I , who is now in charge of this critical investigation , the public prosecu@@ tors were using the col@@ os@@ ons of the former national security advi@@ ser , Michael F@@ ly@@ n@@ n , and the former leader of the tru@@ r campaign , Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ t , as part of an investigation .
one of the President &apos;s personal lawyers , John D@@ O@@ W@@ D , said to the N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws that he was not aware that Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using the whole of the elderly .
&apos;@@ We have been working with Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler and his team since 1 June , because we want to get there &apos; , he said .
against the background of the novel conven@@ ing of the &apos; f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist senior execu@@ tives &apos; , we have no reason to believe that President tru@@ m@@ p is under investigation .
N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has not approved the J@@ our@@ n@@ al data independently .
the use of senior men is a normal part of complex research and is not a tool for listening only to certificates , but also for obtaining information and obtaining data from individuals or businesses .
it is a powerful tool that the public prosecu@@ tors can use to request accusations and prosecu@@ tions , and it can indicate that the work of Mu@@ el@@ ler is far from being done .
the tru@@ m@@ p has denied that he or any member of his team had a plan with Russia during the presidential campaign in 201@@ 6 .
Moscow &apos;s officials have also denied playing a role in the surprising victory of the temp@@ le last November .
the President &apos;s special advi@@ ser , T@@ y C@@ ob@@ b , said that he was unaware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler had started to use the whole of the elderly .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y men &apos;s total is usually secret &apos; , said in the C@@ ob@@ b statement .
the White House is in favour of everything that spe@@ eds up the completion of its work fairly .
the White House is fully committed to working with Mugabe .
J@@ im Com@@ e@@ y , former Director of the F@@ B@@ I , has said three times that the President is not under investigation and we have no reason to think that things have changed &apos; .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Bank is accused of massive mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering infringements .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Government , against the country &apos;s largest mortgage , lo@@ d@@ ged the Com@@ mon@@ g@@ al@@ th Bank on Thursday , submitted an accus@@ ation of mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering and the rules against the financing of terrorism on a massive scale .
the Financial In@@ tel@@ ligence Agency ( A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C ) made public that they have initiated a civil punishment procedure against Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k in the Federal Court because of the &apos; serious and systematic failure &apos; procedure in the largest A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an case and the first in which there is a large bank to blame .
&apos;@@ Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k &apos;s behaviour in this matter has left the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an society without any protection against serious and lasting financial crime &apos; , said in the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C judgment .
Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Ban@@ k said in his statement that they would investigate the charges more closely and respond &apos; when the time is right &apos; .
the largest A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an mortgage borro@@ wed &apos; in time or not at all &apos; from &apos; dubious circumstances &apos; , which concern transactions amounting to more than 77 million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an dollar ( USD 61 million ) , reported A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C .
according to the Agency , the bank has committed 53 700 mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering and acts against the financing of terrorism , particularly with regard to the so-called &apos; intelligent in@@ solvency mach@@ ines &apos; .
the previous largest case of this type was linked earlier this year to the Or@@ bi@@ an popular bet@@ ting medi@@ ator Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p Hol@@ ding , who had just 108 allegations of violation .
Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p paid a fine of USD 45 million and is the biggest civilian punishment in the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an corpor@@ al history .
the A@@ U@@ S@@ TR@@ AC@@ -@@ representative refused to comment on the potential punishment of Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k or whether there may be other banks on the rating of the Agency .
the maximum punishment of money la@@ undering and terrorist financing in the event of a contra@@ vention of the law is USD 18 million of A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an infringement .
intelligent v@@ ending mach@@ ines are a certain type of bank bon@@ us that receives both cash and che@@ que contributions and facilitates the anon@@ ymous contributions of cash .
according to A@@ U@@ S@@ TR@@ AC@@ s , the use of the Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k In@@ telli@@ gent Res@@ our@@ ces after their introduction in May 2012 has increased considerably .
cash contributions reached USD 5.@@ 8 billion in the month before June 201@@ 6 , compared to USD 89 million in Australia for the first six months after the introduction of Com@@ m@@ bank au@@ t@@ om@@ ers .
A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C states in court documents that cash contributions were made from counterfeit names , so that revenue was obtained from a vessel to medicines that import drugs .
&apos;@@ even after Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k &apos;s attention was drawn to a suspect &apos;s mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering or the &apos; Com@@ mb@@ an@@ k accounts &apos; , the Com@@ m@@ bank did not start to monitor its cli@@ ents in order to make it difficult and manage the financing of money la@@ undering and terrorism &apos; , the case documents show .
A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C added that the Com@@ m@@ bank accounts were also used to &apos; ba@@ il out &apos; ; this is a form of money la@@ undering which involves transfers between countries without really having to cross international borders .
two influential women share their success secre@@ ts .
what is there in common with Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cel@@ and@@ i and La@@ il@@ a A@@ l ?
at first sight , these women come from two completely different worl@@ ds .
the New York property cam@@ p@@ an , Bar@@ bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ or@@ an , managed to conver@@ t a thousand dollar loan into five billion property holdings before implementing its expertise on the te@@ len@@ i@@ um , participating in a serious living and co@@ ver@@ t of the A@@ B@@ C , S@@ har@@ k S@@ ec@@ k , S@@ of@@ of@@ ia , S@@ of@@ of@@ of@@ of@@ ia , S@@ .@@ A@@ . , the company of investors .
La@@ il@@ a Ali has been in the foot@@ steps of his father , having become the most successful female po@@ ker of four times the un@@ win@@ ning champi@@ on@@ ina , before his res@@ cent has been added to the roles of the television ad@@ vis@@ or , the author and the speaker .
despite these unique career paths ( or perhaps because of them ) , T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x has been recru@@ ited by both women to help them talk to the gli@@ m@@ mer of hope of breaking stereotypes and achieving ambitious targets for businesses .
last year T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x spoke to women in half of the country and discovered that 80 % of them feel that society has given them a ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ pical role and expectations .
consequently , they came up with a project T@@ he Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject to help women break these barriers .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ on and Ali know a great deal about this ; they may be at the top of their field by now , but the journey was not going well for either .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an was mainly awarded D@@ -@@ s at secondary school and college , and had already worked in the workplace for 20 years by 24 years .
Ali entered one of the most male areas and , in addition , the challenge in his way was to try to get his father off the hoo@@ k , who was an ab@@ y@@ ss of i@@ ko@@ on .
these two words th@@ war@@ t through the knowledge of the difficulties .
that is why we sat down with these powerful women to talk about overcoming the failures , cop@@ ing with success and having a sense of trus@@ ting in business and relationships .
what in@@ spi@@ res you to do about what you are dealing with every day ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am inspired by my own personal objectives every day .
I have sha@@ ped the ha@@ bit of writing things I would like to achieve .
and I look at that list .
I consider myself responsible .
I am , of course , inspired by my children .
I am inspired by my ambitions .
I wish to be a victory for everything I do in life .
I realise that achieving my objectives requires hard work , but I am ready to do so .
my confidence is due to preparation .
so I will spend a lot of time preparing .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : as in La@@ il@@ a , the key to my confidence is the preparation of too much , but I do not draw my inspiration from it .
in fact , I am inspired by the real cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what will happen if I do so ?
what will not happen if I do not ?
this cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity makes me grow from the bed this morning , because I cannot wait for what the day will bring .
if , in some days , I do not know that , I am simply preten@@ ding to pre@@ ach those feelings .
then I will be bold in my own eyes and I will be inspired again .
talk about some of the obstacles in your career , which made you much better in the long term .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : for me , it was the most difficult of my business partner to put my foot behind me and my secre@@ tari@@ al mar@@ ried .
I finished business a year later , but this year of my life - fif@@ thly being a wh@@ eel@@ s - was terrible because I did not have the confidence enough to leave .
I felt humili@@ ated , there was no inspiration at all .
but the amaz@@ ing things are happening .
it is most difficult to believe in these moments when you are facing set@@ backs .
it was an extremely difficult year to get our feet and start business from scra@@ t@@ ch , this time without the partner .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I would say that my career was the most difficult time when I was involved in po@@ lis@@ hing , I was at the top of my career and I decided to bring in divorce .
I did not just separate my hus@@ band , but also the then mountain and someone who taught me all that I know about po@@ lis@@ hing .
I did not believe that I could do without him .
so I started to worry about the future of my career and I had to find time to take a step back and say to myself : &apos; you have all the necessary expertise and experience .
you have all these experiences in the bo@@ xing world .
you will undoubtedly be able to do that &apos; .
so I set up a new team around me and continued my career .
in fact , it was simply necessary to get the right mind@@ set , because all the rest were given the impetus there .
I did what needed to be done , I had to face up to fear and have the courage to get rid of my hus@@ band and mountain and to continue with my career , and everything that was resolved .
when did you feel that you have really made progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I felt that I was successful when I won my first bat@@ tery office .
it was a really good feeling because , starting with the bo@@ xing , I wanted to be one of the best , to be un@@ win@@ ning .
I was able to achieve that goal and I did not win the title of the champi@@ on@@ ships on one occasion , but on four occasions .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one moment when I felt that I had been successful was my 1@@ th year of action .
I was at last there .
I had earned a profit of around 42 000 dollars , which I could not expect .
I immediately went out and bought a new car for both the mother and the father ; they never had a new car ; I allowed cars to take to F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ as where they had their retirement generation .
I felt like the Qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I felt so fla@@ grant .
I will service much more than that in the coming years , but nothing has so far been able to offer the same sense as the opportunity to give parents something back and be@@ at them with surprise .
how did you manage to keep yourself motivated during this 1@@ 1-@@ year period in order to continue working ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I never measured my business by profit , because it was not my aim .
I just wanted to see how far I can go .
I already gave myself a dream on the first day to become the Qu@@ e@@ en of New York &apos;s property .
and I saw myself like a P@@ ope - everyone is tou@@ ching my finger and go@@ ver me .
I had such a small point in my own family .
therefore , when I intensified every day , every hour , I did not really mean serving money .
at the end of the day , I did not know the money .
but all the money that came in was immediately going back to business .
I do not even believe that I had any da@@ un@@ ting days , where I would have thought that o@@ h God , we would not earn money .
I was simply convinced that something would work .
the worst thing that could have happened would have been to abolish the company and become a pretext .
I will then pay a good drin@@ k and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
therefore , I do not believe that the great aspi@@ ration of many people who have made progress is money .
they have other incentives to s@@ pu@@ r them .
and the money was not one of my own .
do you have any advice to anyone who has such great dre@@ ams , but who is being held back by a financial factor ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : when I started to earn a lot of money , I had money that I had to invest in property , but I did not have time .
I was running a company .
and that is why I found five different partners who were not even specialists in the bro@@ ker business , but in various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , in a city that knew their streets through and explo@@ ded .
I approached them and said , &apos; Y@@ ou feel that neighbourhood .
I find the best building .
I am going to give you the money and you will be my partner , &apos; Re@@ g@@ is@@ me &apos; .
the lesson here is that , if you have money , you will keep people in order to earn money from your own money .
and if you have an an@@ them , you can sell it to someone who has money and you can earn money from it .
there are two aspects : An@@ ne and money .
but if you do not have both together , nothing will happen very much .
at the end of the day , I - and my partners too - have worked very well together in all these years with the great investors I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find com@@ ba@@ tive people who like to settle .
it is always possible to raise money if you believe that you have a gi@@ ant and a feeling better than anyone in your part of the world .
what are the two or three things that you do every morning , which will help you make progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I do not know about you , but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel over-@@ burden@@ ed , being a mother , a business@@ like , a spo@@ use ... all the roles we play as a woman .
I have reached a point in my life that I really had to put in place this morning &apos;s rou@@ tine .
I like to stand up and just feel thank@@ ful .
gratitude for the up@@ ris@@ ings , for their health , for their children , for their families .
I will often write up my ambitions for the next day and , if I wake up , I will look again at this list .
Me@@ di@@ v@@ et@@ a .
I sometimes write in a daily sha@@ m .
line always with the po@@ ke .
and I will always be fai@@ th@@ ful to the first thing in the morning , because if I do not do it then it will not be done .
for me , it is ultimately about priorities .
these are things that are important to me : my sp@@ in@@ ity , a focus on the uni@@ verse and God , then training and putting their health first .
thanks to this , everything else seems simple .
I feel I can pick up on all the challenges that face me in the course of the day .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cel@@ an : I am linking things to a qu@@ e@@ ue of importance .
I am working through a list of my tasks , which is endless and ridiculous .
and I put in place what is most important .
what are the real priorities ?
I will try to live up to these most important things .
what are you doing to bring yourself to a great meeting in the right state of mind ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I imagine I would fail .
how bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re it is .
I think I@@ ss@@ and , I am failing .
I am H@@ ir@@ mu@@ tan myself , and that makes me more effort .
I can imagine anyone who is competing with me - I am very com@@ ba@@ tive in nature because I am one of ten children and we never received enough attention from our parents .
I can be very con@@ scienti@@ ous .
and I will always be here too thoroughly prepared .
too much preparation reinforces my confidence .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : it is amaz@@ ing how con@@ tras@@ ting we are in this respect .
we are two successful people and this shows how different things work for different people .
I like to imagine that I will be successful .
I like to think of the end , which is success .
I can imagine it in a more spiri@@ tual way , I can actually see it happening .
I see the thro@@ wing around , the fight taking place , the winner of the w@@ et and the return of the clo@@ th@@ es , as I have always done , celebrating a victory with the code .
the same applies to meetings .
however , I will always prepare myself thoroughly ; this confidence is due to the preparation , because in a few , there is a fear that I will not do well or I will not say the right things or the information I need .
that is where the preparation for the game lies for me .
however , I will always enter by stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ing the end result .
you have both been very successful in your career .
how will you pass it on ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am very exc@@ iting to be part of the T@@ .@@ J@@ . M@@ A@@ X@@ I project Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject , because I feel that this is an opportunity to do good .
a large number of women need insp@@ iring , encouraging them to pursue their dre@@ ams and objectives .
in all of us we are in the club .
it is , in fact , a matter of con@@ g@@ ress and of having the necessary tools around us , with the right people , the people who have managed to achieve the things that you are trying to achieve .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one thing I believe to be very good is the insp@@ iring of people .
I was therefore very anxious to have been asked to cooperate with Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
I will try to eat the mil@@ l of indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward .
many people are starting to implement their dre@@ ams , but they tend to be wrong on some points .
we are therefore trying to help them to focus on their objective .
everything we teach is practical .
business planning , even as simple as li@@ f@@ ti@@ ll , everything that is needed to set up a company .
what advice would you give to women who want to make progress in male areas ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am acting in one of the most male areas , which is the son .
coming after my father , who was the world i@@ ko@@ on and the best of all times , was rather discoura@@ ging .
for me , the cru@@ x of the matter was actually to find this tal@@ ent , courage , strength in itself .
the first thing I had to believe in ourselves is that I can go round and succeed .
at the time , no one , apart from me and from me , was involved in any restriction other than those I had set myself on my own feet .
if you believe in ourselves and find your passion , no one can prevent you .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the journey between finding inspiration and taking a stance like me - the &apos; Ro@@ y@@ al of New York &apos;s property &apos; - and the crossing of the fin@@ i@@ Å¡@@ i@@ line is immen@@ sely long .
and in this intermediate phase , which is your career career career on a daily basis , many tal@@ ents are needed .
these tal@@ ents do not need to be be@@ a@@ ten with an ob@@ scene .
I am sure that , in the area of La@@ il@@ a , it was also necessary to decide what the right people are , the right moun@@ tains , when to start , when to finish , when there is a lot of money that can be put in , what cannot be put in place if you are hard to work .
these are all subjec@@ tive decisions .
I will try to give some support to these efforts so that these women really feel : &apos; o@@ il@@ ls , I have understood now .
let me try .
there are my three priorities here &apos; .
if they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen , I will be s@@ mil@@ ing at home in the evening .
what is at your din@@ ner ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : too many y@@ el@@ low .
time@@ fram@@ es , books , little b@@ el@@ t wine , my day .
probably on water trees .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : my night is a small green wa@@ ke@@ -up call , because I tried to break the ha@@ bit every morning to look at the phone .
that is why I found it .
it was s@@ lee@@ ping .
but it has never worked .
and it still stands there .
and my phone is still on my night .
what book do you read now ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : E@@ igh@@ th or n@@ in@@ th times ; &apos; to win friends and influence people &apos; .
this will keep me on the right track .
I believe that this is still the best book written in this area , it does not matter what your dre@@ ams are ; dre@@ ams cannot be achieved without the other people .
and it is possible to deal with this today just as it was in the past .
I like to read it over time .
this will help me to get down the right path again .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am learning at eating school , so I will read the book &apos; N@@ is@@ free diet &apos; .
it talks about eating cereals and how they affect our body .
I am very interested in that .
what is your best advice to cope with the successes and failures ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : ignore the was@@ te@@ fulness .
they are met by all sorts of different images .
you must remove them from their bra@@ ins .
keep you away from the fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ers .
they are te@@ aring you out of energy .
I look to the vi@@ ri@@ ses as an asset .
they come at night , they are s@@ las@@ hing your w@@ alle@@ ts and they are leaving .
the pessimis@@ ts in any team situation destroy the cre@@ w faster than you can look the other eye , because people who manage themselves want others to feel badly .
they are pul@@ ling the good people with their own ho@@ le .
I can perfectly avoid all the negative people within a rate of 50 km , because my aim is to be positive and to take up everything that gives and to oppose everything I have to offer .
so why should I want to spend a minute on such people ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : we need to be consistent .
we will start on many occasions with the conviction that we will now take this path .
we will do it , and we will do it .
however , people do not respect it for enough time .
sometimes they give up just before they reach the last villa@@ ge .
so I think it is necessary to keep on course .
if you feel passion@@ ate about something , if you believe something , you have to be consistent .
and you have to do the hard work that success requires .
Mrs Cor@@ cel@@ an : a great deal of effort must be made to ensure continuity .
do you know what is needed for this ?
it is from the bottom up .
if you start something , that will stop .
many are sha@@ re@@ holder , but not particularly partial , end@@ -@@ users .
Chinese Internet censorship is playing a difficult game of c@@ at and mo@@ use .
according to the experts , a shift that can affect many users , from noti@@ fications to companies , suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet .
&apos;@@ seems that the restrictions are becoming ever more intense but , at the same time , the Internet is more powerful than ever &apos; , E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , who has written a book &apos; no@@ w I k@@ no@@ w W@@ h@@ o Com@@ ra@@ des A@@ re &apos; , which deals with the influence of the Internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
the restrictions placed on the Internet in Beijing are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China .
according to experts , China &apos;s control has not been strengthened as much as possible and , in many cases , the game of c@@ at and mo@@ use continues .
one day after A@@ pp@@ le &apos;s visit last week , people started to spread the way in the social media in China to gain access to these tools , which are so easy that it can even be found in a technical ali@@ en .
this involved regis@@ tering a person &apos;s son of applications to another country where V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ applications are still available .
nevertheless , the four@@ -@@ day test shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the box .
a number of Chinese Internet service providers said on Thursday in their social media accounts , on websites or in our tan@@ ks that Chinese security officials would test a new way of finding an online address for services that would con@@ struct or use illegal content .
when they have been found , the authorities , according to these companies , request that Internet service providers require their customers to put an end to such practices .
if customers continue , service providers and Chinese officials will inter@@ rupt their Community minutes .
the Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the fa@@ ke request to comment .
studies point out that tens to hundreds of millions of people in China use V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ e and other types of sof@@ tw@@ are to get away from a large fire@@ wall .
although the bloc@@ ka@@ des of foreign television broadcas@@ ts and por@@ no@@ graph@@ y exclude many people , they pose only a small challenge to China &apos;s vast web service of Internet users .
the Chinese President X@@ I J@@ in@@ page has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet over the years , but he has also brought up technology and the Internet as critical factors for China &apos;s future economic development .
since cyber@@ space has started to play a more central role in the whole of China , government control aspects have evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to find out the scope of new efforts , as many users and businesses are not discussing them openly , fe@@ aring the Chinese Government &apos;s dis@@ approval .
however , some of the frequent users have said that it is becoming more difficult to avoid restrictions .
one student who is stu@@ dying in the United States and lea@@ ther to China from summer holidays said that he was blocked by local V@@ P@@ N .
he said that he took that period away as a kind of medi@@ tation from the social media , and he left F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k to his friends to explain why he has been driven into the ground .
an app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p of the environmental doc@@ torate in China said that , without Google &apos;s f@@ it@@ ness IT , it has become more difficult to carry out research , even though the university has found alternative prin@@ ted so that students do not always need the Internet .
according to his asser@@ tion , he has now found a new way of by@@ passing the great fire@@ wall without dis@@ closing what it is all about .
according to Chinese Internet observers , some V@@ P@@ N@@ s are still working and China could do much more to intensify the restrictions .
&apos;@@ We believe that if the government had decided to do so , it would have stopped the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ use much more by now &apos; , V@@ P@@ N@@ D@@ da , said the V@@ P@@ N@@ Da@@ da site in 2015 , which would help the Chinese users to find a V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ e , a representative .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the government had sent out more into the bot@@ tles , the de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants would be much more complicated &apos; , the representative who refused to call himself in China because of the sensitivity of the group &apos;s work .
&apos;@@ I@@ f they did not do so , because they have to give people or businesses a little brea@@ thing space &apos; .
the Chinese online restrictions are often cyclical .
the current climate is partly due to the imminent , important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party , which is the 19@@ th Congress of the Parties in the autumn .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ e had un@@ foreseeable inter@@ rup@@ tions before the similar meeting at that time .
like economic policy or external affairs , China is also part of a complex and often inadequate political process .
according to analy@@ sts , government minis@@ tries on the eve of Congress feel pres@@ su@@ ri@@ sed to show that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem .
&apos;@@ so it is certainly not in the V@@ P@@ N@@ s a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ sis &apos; , Paul Tri@@ ol@@ o , the head of the global technological depart@@ ment of E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia G@@ ro@@ u@@ p .
&apos;@@ a more difficult environment for the na@@ vig@@ ating of users and new opportunities and approaches will simply enable China to better include certain parts of the V@@ P@@ N@@ s in the choices and location chosen by Beijing &apos; , he said .
the Chinese population is learning to overcome these difficulties in the past age .
earlier this summer , an Internet gi@@ ant , T@@ en@@ c@@ ent , started to limit the time allowed to play a popular game of &apos; h@@ on@@ or K@@ ing@@ s &apos; by the youn@@ gest of the 12 and two hours of those aged between 12 and 18 .
that is why young people in China have begun to use a age@@ -@@ old solution - false documents .
is your &apos; han@@ non of K@@ ing@@ s &apos; time limit ?
are you interested in getting a document which shows that you are older than 18 ? &apos; the recent advertising asked the social media in China ?
&apos;@@ There is no problem .

he was ex@@ tol@@ led for ob@@ struc@@ ting a global cyber attack .
and then he was arrested .
when K@@ ron@@ os was adver@@ tised for the first time in Russian sub@@ ur@@ bs in 2014 , the questionable price of USD 7 000 indicated that the sale of bad assets is a profitable undertaking .
the K@@ ron@@ o@@ st was adver@@ tised as a pu@@ ppe@@ t tool capable of obtaining data , including u@@ ser@@ s and pa@@ ro@@ s , the P@@ IN@@ -@@ codes of the cash mach@@ ines and personal information which will be useful in breaking the security issues .

he had plans to fly back to his home in Britain .
the market community reacted with surprise and scepticism to arrest its valued sta@@ r .
some warned that claims against Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s could damage the relationship between &apos; white &apos; ang@@ lers - researchers looking for sof@@ tw@@ are weaknesses in order to identify and solve problems , not to commit crimes or so@@ wing chaos - and law enforcement agencies .
others doub@@ tless thought that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in might have been an attack on the creation of such sof@@ tw@@ are .
in July 2014 he asked T@@ wit@@ ter , and no one has a K@@ ron@@ os face , which is an seem@@ ingly od@@ d request when he himself was the author of a sha@@ m .
although the precise details of the inter@@ connections with Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s K@@ ron@@ os are not clear , market investi@@ g@@ ators have often ignored legal problems in search of vulnerable sites .
in recent years , large technical companies have put up &apos; f@@ laws of errors &apos; in order to form@@ alise the process of reporting problems for researchers and compensa@@ ting for their work .
the D@@ ef@@ con@@ i Conference , the un@@ restricted gathering of security experts from all over the world , has also had a ten@@ se relationship with law enforcement agencies .
in 2002 , F@@ B@@ I , for example , was arrested in the V@@ eg@@ as Ho@@ tel by Russian k@@ r@@ hy@@ ph@@ et experts following the publication of sof@@ tw@@ are , which , according to the authorities , could have damaged the safety of certain types of e-@@ books .
the D@@ ig@@ i@@ rights organisation Elec@@ tron@@ ic Fron@@ ti@@ er F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ ti@@ on said in his statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s and that it would investigate the matter more closely .

by regis@@ tering dom@@ e@@ en USD 10@@ .@@ 69 , he launched a &apos; slaughter link &apos; which stopped the proliferation of sof@@ tw@@ are .
his original intention was not to stop the attack but to monitor its spread .
Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins , who is working as K@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ s Lo@@ gi@@ c rese@@ ar@@ cher in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , said in an inter@@ view that he did not attend the College and had learned to write sof@@ tw@@ are himself .
the company did not give its comments .
Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in tried to be anon@@ y@@ mit@@ y , with the media having their constant presence in Mal@@ wa@@ re@@ T@@ ec@@ h , but the British tab@@ lo@@ ids revealed his identity .
he was gl@@ ori@@ fied by the cyber security community for this achievement and he received special recognition from the S@@ C A@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ s industry in Europe .

it is disappointing that his ill description of the epi@@ demics igno@@ res all the wonderful things that the state has to offer .
Sen@@ ator Mag@@ gi@@ e H@@ ass@@ an , a democra@@ t of New H@@ amp@@ shire , mentioned the remarks &apos; anti-@@ g@@ ig@@ an@@ tic &apos; and said in T@@ wit@@ ter that his state was not in any way different from others fighting for widespread use of op@@ i@@ ates .
Sen@@ ator Je@@ an@@ ne s@@ ha@@ he@@ en , as well as a democra@@ t , agreed .
&apos;@@ It is totally unacceptable for the President to speak of the N@@ HS in this way &apos; , he wrote in T@@ wit@@ ter .
that is the case with N@@ H and the completely false dep@@ ic@@ tion of the epidemic .
the most dead@@ ly drug addiction - the category of drugs com@@ prising hero@@ in and f@@ en@@ tan@@ y@@ l - is the most dead@@ ly drug epidemic in American history .
in 201@@ 6 , more people than weapons or car accidents were killed - according to the estimated 59 000 people were analysed by the New York Times - and is now the main cause of death for the Americans under the age of 50 .
in 2015 , more than 97 million people in the United States used anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs , according to data from the Agency for the E@@ radi@@ cation of substances and mental health .
it is estimated that 12 million of these people did this in a way that had not been determined by the doctor .
New H@@ amp@@ shire has been a hard blow and its inhabitants repeatedly raised the problem during the 201@@ 6 campaign for presidential candidates .
in New H@@ amp@@ shire , it was estimated that in 201@@ 6 , 4@@ 70 over@@ do@@ ses were killed in comparison with 4@@ 39 cases in 2015 .
in 2012 , they were 16@@ 3 according to health and service statistics in New H@@ amp@@ shire .

D@@ is@@ ne@@ y long-@@ held advi@@ ser and leader Mar@@ ty S@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ r died at an age of 80 .
S@@ k@@ la@@ r , who died in his home L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Hol@@ ly@@ wood H@@ ill@@ s neighbourhood on 27 July , retained contacts with the company following the retirement in 2009 , which was motivated precisely on the 5@@ 4@@ th anniversary of the opening of the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
last year , on the opening day of S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i D@@ is@@ ne@@ y in China , he became the only member of the tru@@ ck ( so the company invi@@ tes its employees ) who has been involved in opening all 12 D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Par@@ k around the world .
and , less than two weeks before the death , he took part in for@@ ging D@@ is@@ ne@@ y f@@ ans 23 , sharing re@@ min@@ ders on D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
his death was reported by D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y without mentioning its cause .
he was eight years old .
the post of S@@ k@@ lar@@ i newspaper T@@ he D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws was temporary , but he returned from D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land after U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . in 195@@ 6 to work in its advertising depart@@ ment .
he will soon be the main version of W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y in writing advertising materials , p@@ ren@@ i@@ er managers , speeches , slo@@ ts , presen@@ tations and short fil@@ ms , such as a piece of paper that helped the company to obtain approval for the construction of W@@ al@@ t D@@ or@@ l@@ d and E@@ p@@ co@@ t in Central F@@ or@@ l@@ da .
he also worked with Wales and his bro@@ ther Ro@@ y@@ ga on the annual reports of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
&apos;@@ S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote in his auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y , &apos; D@@ rea@@ m IT , do : my dear H@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ C@@ en@@ tur@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Ma@@ gi@@ s &apos; , just six or seven years after the end of the College ( 2013 ) .
however , despite the fact that W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y trus@@ ted S@@ k@@ lar@@ i in its correspon@@ dence , in 196@@ 4 , he appointed the Far@@ m F@@ at@@ vi@@ lion in New York &apos;s World of 196@@ 4 , where D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y was sha@@ ped by ex@@ hibi@@ tions and demonstrations .
S@@ k@@ la@@ r W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y wrote a che@@ ese Ford for the Ma@@ gi@@ c sk@@ y@@ way , which saw the atten@@ dance of anim@@ at@@ ro@@ on@@ ic din@@ ners and co@@ op@@ ers , and which was their main link with large corporate spon@@ sors .
it was the start of the second review of S@@ k@@ lar@@ i in the enterprise .
as an increasingly important Member and leader of I@@ mag@@ ine@@ ers , he was increasingly involved in W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , who died at the end of 196@@ 6 long before the opening of W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ l@@ d in 197@@ 1 and E@@ p@@ co@@ t in 198@@ 2 .
after she died from W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y 6@@ 5-@@ year l@@ ung cancer , the boat S@@ k@@ la@@ r was returned to the world of writing when she was told that the company &apos;s management workers had not prepared a public speech , although &apos; it was no secret that W@@ al@@ t was dying &apos; , as he wri@@ tes in his car bio@@ graph@@ y .
S@@ k@@ la@@ r , as he said , was outra@@ ged by the fact that he had to sign a statement to which Mrs D@@ is@@ ne@@ y is signing , but he realised that a lack of planning was a sign that the death of W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y had been paraly@@ sed by company leaders .
&apos;@@ In reality they were all afraid of death &apos; , S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote .
Martin Adri@@ an S@@ k@@ la@@ r was born in New B@@ run@@ s@@ w@@ ick in February in New J@@ er@@ se@@ y .
his father , Le@@ on , was a teacher and mother , with a ne@@ i@@ u@@ field L@@ il@@ y@@ n F@@ u@@ ch@@ s , worked at J@@ oh@@ n@@ son &amp; J@@ oh@@ n@@ son , before he had a family home to L@@ ong Be@@ ac@@ h@@ i C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia when Mar@@ ty was 12 .
after secondary school , he had several temporary jobs , for example , in D@@ ou@@ g@@ l@@ la Air@@ cra@@ f@@ ts , as T@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ der H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g@@ eri@@ resta@@ ur@@ an dri@@ ve@@ -@@ in , as well as as as as an urgent carri@@ er of the postal services .
but in May 195@@ 5 , when his third year from U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . , he received the message from S@@ k@@ la@@ r that he would call D@@ is@@ ne@@ y marketing and advertising leader E@@ . Car@@ d@@ on W@@ al@@ k@@ ner .
at that time , S@@ k@@ la@@ r U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . En@@ vo@@ y Da@@ il@@ y B@@ ru@@ in was a new chief ed@@ it@@ or .
W@@ al@@ ker asked him to come to the work inter@@ view for the post of creat@@ or or of the ed@@ it@@ or in the newspaper T@@ he D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws .
W@@ al@@ ker said that the subject par@@ k will soon be opened .
and it needs him .
he had an inter@@ view after 20 minutes in Wales .
the S@@ k@@ la@@ r also had to prove W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y that he knows what is going to do .
&apos;@@ i was there for two weeks and I had to present W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s le@@ th concept &apos; , he recalled on the website of the affor@@ da@@ bility D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ ue .
&apos;@@ I@@ f he had not liked , he would have thrown me out of the door and made a professional .
fortunately , however , it liked Wales .
I was 21 .
it was frigh@@ tening .
I had never worked at a professional level &apos; .
the lessons learned in S@@ k@@ la@@ r from W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y ( and some other person too ) at some point &apos; M@@ ik@@ a@@ k would be &apos; , that is , the executive manifes@@ to on board .
the comm@@ and involve the following , for example : the feeling of their target group .
an attempt to &apos; go into the sho@@ es of visitors &apos; in order to experience a si@@ ck@@ ness like they do .
in the case of Ju@@ us@@ ta , there is only one thing at the same time .
the T@@ em@@ em@@ ian divorce expert Bo@@ b R@@ og@@ ers once called S@@ k@@ lar@@ i for a sor@@ ce@@ rer &apos;s app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce , a role that M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ir played in the &apos; fan@@ tas@@ y &apos; film - ( 19@@ 40 ) - because he had bro@@ ke@@ red the philosophy of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y for three generations of design design .
he is left behind by his wife , a ne@@ i@@ u@@ field bro@@ ther Le@@ a@@ h Ger@@ ber , a da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter L@@ es@@ li@@ e S@@ k@@ la@@ r , a son Ho@@ w@@ ard and four grand@@ children .
S@@ k@@ la@@ r was a committed leader of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
he regularly carried out three benchmarks at the time of M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ire , which showed him time in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , Paris and T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , and the M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ire gol@@ den War .
and he never forgotten something that W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y had taught him .
when D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y developed a C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia Ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ e par@@ k , S@@ k@@ la@@ r reminded the plan@@ ners to add actions that parents and children could do together , as W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had requested .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou reminded everyone that D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and existed at all because it was normal for Wales to take its da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters from Di@@ an@@ e and S@@ har@@ on G@@ ri@@ ff@@ i@@ th@@ i par@@ k to ca@@ rou@@ sel &apos; , he said to the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , T@@ im L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Times in 2002 , &apos; and the pa@@ w@@ ns on board board and s@@ no@@ w@@ .&apos; this is what we are talking about .
he thought he had become a colleague of great interest .
but why were his symp@@ toms so different ?
at Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ point , he was given a large do@@ se of th@@ se@@ ta@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ gen to reduce the fe@@ ver .
over the rest of the day , he was questioned , stor@@ med , sor@@ ted and rese@@ ar@@ ched .
none of the tests showed anything , but they were also not willing to send home .
he understood the cause .
for the last two years , he had taken a medicine called e@@ than@@ ol to treat S@@ j@@ Ã¶@@ g@@ ren@@ i sy@@ nd@@ ro@@ me .
the medicine reduces the ability of the immun@@ e system , and it limited its capacity to combat infection .
S@@ j@@ Ã¶@@ n is an au@@ x@@ immun@@ e dis@@ order - a rather my@@ ste@@ rious disease in which poor water pi@@ pes are attacking normal places , as if it were an inva@@ sive body that so@@ wed the chaos in this case , which produces te@@ ars and heart , as well as in some categories .
this week &apos;s e@@ than@@ ol statistics were helpful in reducing the hea@@ vi@@ er pain .
but he knew that , because of this medicine , he was rather ab@@ ated in the event of a serious infection .
when the at@@ se@@ ta@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ en started to work , the patient felt much better .
Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ c doctors decided to leave him to hospital for night .
when it comes to a virus such as doctors &apos; suspects , he will be well with him next day and will be returned home .
when , for the first time in his new patient , G@@ ir@@ ard has given himself a course with infections , to which the people who em@@ it e@@ than@@ ol are sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a long list .
transplants cannot be treated before diagnosis is carried out , which is why he focused on bac@@ terial defec@@ ts .
one bac@@ teri@@ um which attacks people with immunity is a food addi@@ tive .
it is often found in un@@ written milk and che@@ ese , and it causes terrible a@@ ci@@ di@@ fication , sho@@ cks and tab@@ oo@@ s that he did not have .
the occupational disease is another infection that has spread among the pro@@ tag@@ onists of this medicine , but it did not have a c@@ lu@@ e or a lack of air .
even more widespread bac@@ teri@@ um Sta@@ phy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us could cause over-@@ infection but , again , it did not have excessive complaints .
nevertheless , a doctor would plan to start a large-scale antibio@@ tic treatment that would cover all these risks .
however , when he met the patient , he did not feel that he would be hard hit by a serious infection .
Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ c doctors had not given him antibiotics .
the doctor had the opportunity to delay the administration of antibiotics and just to monitor and wait , but if the patient had read one of the in@@ defec@@ ts of which he had read the treatment , it would even have resulted in the death of a couple of hours .
the situation was made even more complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was aller@@ gic to the pen@@ sion@@ er line , even though he did not remember what happened when he took it .
it created a shift in the relationship between risk and benefit .
the ty@@ p@@ ically low contribution to whether or not to start antibio@@ tic treat@@ ments will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked the colleague , the second resident , to assess the patient .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard did not tell my colleague that he was planning an antibio@@ tic treatment ; he simply asked for a look at the patient and his recommendation .
my colleague met the patient and agreed .
although he saw a good thing , he would be virtually defence@@ less against it in the event of an infection .
the doctor should give antibiotics to the patient .
as a patient has experienced a pen@@ sion@@ er aller@@ gy , G@@ ir@@ ard should allow him to be tested to check whether he is tole@@ rating a medicine that is not a pen@@ sion@@ er but a close relatives .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard has asked for a te@@ st@@ do@@ s to be man@@ ned .
if he had had had a serious response to the medicine , he would have suffered a blow or his blood pressure would have been humili@@ ated .
neither happened .
he was therefore appointed in his whole story .
a few hours later , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard gave a speech .
the patient &apos;s body temperature had risen to 39 degrees .
he rus@@ hed to look at the patient .
the patient &apos;s face was the air la@@ yer in the do@@ or@@ step , and it was the Roma .
although he seemed to be un@@ comfortable , his heart and blood pressure were fine .
the doctor than@@ ked innu@@ mer@@ able happ@@ iness that he had given antibiotics to the patient .
he asked for another Dr T@@ y@@ len@@ oli to be man@@ ned , and when he had to look at the patient for the last time , he pain@@ ted deeply .
the fe@@ ver has gone down .
H@@ ig@@ ine g@@ el@@ ling and the Roma have disappeared .
next evening , when G@@ ir@@ ard came into hospital for an exchange in a woman , he first visited the patient .
he had also received five other patients , but for that patient , G@@ ir@@ ard at home was the most concerned after hand@@ ing over to his current team .
during the hours when he did not see him , his blood organ@@ ism had grown in the labor@@ atory .
it was still too early to say what this is more precise .
it was clear , however , that this is a bac@@ teri@@ um that is strong enough for Pet@@ r@@ i to grow quickly , and that it is not a Sta@@ ph@@ y@@ lo@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us or a Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ i@@ an-@@ Com@@ mer@@ cial hospital .
the list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit .
it took another two days before they were able to identify the bac@@ teri@@ a at last .
it was a supplementary lo@@ opho@@ le .
G@@ ir@@ ard , like everyone who looked after the patient , was surprised .
as a doctor , images of diseases are appe@@ aring in a fine .
for G@@ ir@@ ar@@ d , there was an additional lo@@ t@@ tery disease that comes from un@@ pas@@ t@@ Ã¶@@ st@@ ru@@ ed milk and soft che@@ ese , and which causes birth , w@@ as@@ ta@@ ge and tab@@ r@@ ust .
he worked even further on this unusual infection and found that , while people with a normal immun@@ e system might experience these symp@@ toms , they would normally recover quickly like a patient &apos;s colleague .
however , in the case of pregnant women , the older than 65 years old and the affected immun@@ e system of people , the infection may trigger outside the se@@ ces@@ sion - sometimes without the appearance of conventional symp@@ toms - and enter the blood cycle .
it can spread over the entire body like the cost .
this type of infection , called in@@ va@@ sive additional product , can result in up to 30 % of the deaths of patients suffering it .
indeed , although it is not as widespread as bo@@ bo@@ xes , the extra lo@@ tte@@ ries may be equally dead@@ ly .
an early use of antibiotics can save life .
when it comes to a food@@ -@@ trans@@ mitted disease , what was the food bearing this bac@@ teri@@ um ?
although the patient and his colleague did not have un@@ paid milk or soft che@@ ese on a journey , the search for the Internet this summer found an additional outbreak in Scotland , linked to a smo@@ ke@@ red beef .
neither of them had ea@@ ten up beef , but they were fighting a slightly smo@@ ke@@ red gap .
where they have pic@@ ked up the bac@@ teri@@ um in detail remains a secret .
when a doctor &apos;s team had found out what a patient &apos;s fault was , they were able to adapt antibiotics .
his three-@@ week treatment ended in July .
doctors advised him to take him cal@@ mly to the end of the summer , but today he feels quite well and has returned to the mu@@ se@@ um and his lo@@ ved work .
Pakistan &apos;s valued India does not find refuge .
after 70 years of the greatest wave of population in the history of the parti@@ tioning of two countries , the brea@@ thing is still moving from Pakistan to India .
tens of thousands of people who do not even have the legal right to work in India are waiting for them in the host camps on the border of two countries .
therefore , many have no choice but to extra@@ ct illegally near temporary habi@@ ta@@ ts - the Indian authorities , on the other hand , are following the movements of those who cross the border very closely .
most of the arri@@ vals from Pakistan cannot wait for this kind of reception .
there is no work , no house , no money , no fire .
there we worked in the fields , we were farmers .
here , however , we are forced to bur@@ st the stone to earn our living &apos; , in an 8@@ 1-@@ year-old J@@ og@@ a@@ se .
for us , division is not over .
the wa@@ i@@ vers are still trying to return to their own country .
and when they come here they have nothing &apos; , they added an elderly man in a camp near the city of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ l .
following Indian independence from British colonial rule in 19@@ 47 , over 15 million people lost their homes .
this separation caused a period of months of violence , in which at least one million people lost their lives due to religious hatred .
in the midst of bloody chaos , brea@@ th@@ es and si@@ ts from Pakistan , which has just been formed , while Muslims were moving in the opposite direction .
despite emig@@ ration , Pakistan has still been valued as one of the numerous minority groups .
they account for about 1.@@ 6 % of the country &apos;s 200@@ -@@ million population in various estimates .
many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear kidna@@ pping , rape and forced marriages .
&apos;@@ The persecution started shortly after the separation &apos; , in J@@ og@@ d@@ as , whose family home only a few months before the two countries divided from drought , to access the current areas of Pakistan .
it was not a day when we could have lived in peace .
I wanted to come back to live in the middle of my prices .
the national government of the Indian Prime Minister , N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra mo@@ d , has said that it wants to make it easier for persecuted people in India for religious reasons .
last year the government started to allow immigrants to obtain citizenship in their place of residence , in the past , the whole thing went through the central government .
the prices that have relo@@ cated from Pakistan to India opens up the possibility of accelerated citizenship after seven years of residence .
however , due to bureaucratic delays , this process is often much more time-@@ consuming .
6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian nationality in 2005 .
however , according to him , many have abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that they do not expect a good life in India .
the government does not provide any support .
we are like cattle without the ow@@ ner .
we are simply trying to survive on our own &apos; , to drin@@ k K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i .
but even worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities .
those who do not have citizenship must suffer harassment from intelligence agencies .
they are rou@@ tin@@ ely treated as agents of suspicion and of Pakistan &apos; , he explained .
S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ al , which laid the foundations for a dedicated ch@@ arity organisation to help prices from Jo@@ d@@ h@@ u@@ l , had high expectations of the fashion that came to power in 2014 , but he has now had to be disappointed .
tensions between India and Pakistan have increased under the Mo@@ di Government , which is why migrants are suffering the most .
&apos;@@ The@@ y will change into hel@@ l &apos; , drin@@ k So@@ d@@ h@@ al .
for many , however , the treatment of this link is better than that of life in Pakistan .
Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i fled India with two adults two years ago , as he had started killing threats from P@@ ak@@ istan@@ is neighbours .
&apos;@@ We had to fle@@ e to India to save our lives &apos; , said 6@@ 5-@@ year-old Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i , whose grand@@ parents came from the current Indian territories , but found themselves on the wrong side of the border by breaking the country .
my grand@@ father joined the other side for his work .
but he told us that we would move to India at the right moment , because he knew that the future would be dangerous for prices .

the revenues from the sale of an activity go to support this type of protection project .
on last week &apos;s ti@@ ger Day , over EUR 1 000 was collected at ch@@ arity sales .
J@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k K@@ ol@@ k : P@@ u@@ ha@@ ke for a whole year , so there is no need for leave .
of course , I was personally guilty of this leave not being broken .
I was also a somewhat necessary employee , but perhaps the only one who considered himself irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
it was to blame for having b@@ lin@@ ded my b@@ reat@@ h .
the quo@@ tation at the beginning of this Chamber is fine in that it is completely true .
that was the case - the new authority that I started in March of this year called for a certain amount of work , but something at that job bo@@ ys so much better for me to feed a new life for three months , and I cle@@ ared up myself .
this is a time of summer , of holiday .
it is time to make the promises of the New Year , look at what has happened in life and what direction this whole colour is taking .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at will it be Christmas and ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ! &apos; H@@ ends a decent citizen wrong@@ ly .
perhaps it is , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas does not fit to think about life and to set targets .
well , I am speaking only for myself - I will not be able to make any changes to the ye@@ arly break .
that is too difficult for me .
of course , good luck and jo@@ y are found in the Christmas season : I like the beginning of the light tri@@ ump@@ h , like Christmas revenues , and J@@ es@@ us also had a very sympa@@ thetic attitude , a revolu@@ tionary tone on the back .
nevertheless , during the Christmas period , I am mostly very ti@@ red and sometimes stressed - for the sake of this ab@@ us@@ ive bl@@ ind@@ ness .
yes , I do a great deal of work , perhaps more , if I were to do some k@@ u@@ p in the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and I have constantly cle@@ ared .
for the most part , I have run up like the or@@ a@@ v wh@@ eel@@ s in the run-up to Christmas - gi@@ f@@ ts , at least four Christmas bir@@ ds , a slightly greater work@@ load ...
given the un@@ ce@@ asing social pressure to feel unconditional jo@@ y and peace in the heart , the difficulties of the Christmas period are obvious .
however , a desperate person and a ti@@ red person cannot make good decisions , let alone ref@@ ine them .
these things need to be done more or less clearly .
a ti@@ red person is perhaps thro@@ wing an empty and res@@ ounding promise , which will help to lay the foundations of the future as much as it can from the purchase of a lo@@ t@@ tery ticket .
a promise that is meant to change something should be thought through cal@@ mly , it should be useful , it should be a plan .
the plan , in contrast to the promise , contains not only a code of conduct , but also a few minor set@@ backs .
that is why I say that the best time to deliver on promises is now , in the summer .
you just need to rest cal@@ mly and bur@@ n out why this fa@@ ti@@ gue is as high ( if it is ) .
if you do not commit yourself to sil@@ ly be@@ tra@@ ying during your holiday period , a few weeks will be enough to find a place in your own lives that is worthy of si@@ ck@@ ness and to find out exactly how this is done .
I think it is important to live as much as possible that leave does not need to rest on an ongoing basis , not once a year .
so that leave is an extra honour , not a b@@ las@@ h for survival , during which it will be down@@ lo@@ aded so much as to be able to with@@ stand next year in any way .
I recommend to everyone that there is at least one simple promise - if you have to rise in the next morning , that the House should s@@ lee@@ p in good time in the evening .
I believe that , if one in ten of my constituents were to listen to my advice , life would be considerably better in Estonia .
I myself intend to follow my advice .
such attempts drive people .
it would be a very good thing if there were some thought and conclusions to be drawn .
the suggestion to spend a little more time investigating the background of those who want to go to war is obvious .
more generally , however , everyone could have a strategy that they share for themselves in the social media .
at national level , however , the question must be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threat to the social media .
the life expectancy of bo@@ gu@@ s created under controlled conditions expi@@ red by the summer school , but certainly not by the ski@@ pp@@ ers .
the fourth Est@@ onian person in Finland received heart .
together with Finnish media groups , doctors in Northern Estonia ( P@@ ER@@ H ) , G@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ter T@@ ory G@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ter and P@@ en@@ t@@ ra , a her@@ di@@ olog@@ ist in the region of Finland , have estimated that the post-@@ operation period has been expected .
&apos;@@ It is very difficult to say how long a patient would have been able to live without a new heart &apos; was talking P@@ o@@ der .
for a maximum of eight years now , doctors have been living on a heart pu@@ mp in the world .
the man himself re@@ alises and is not prepared to talk about this .
he was diagno@@ sed for the first time two years ago , and the disease had already reached the final stage , the cause of heart was Islam .
&apos;@@ Trans@@ fer for this sick was the only option &apos; , Denmark added .
according to Kar@@ di@@ o@@ gy , after transplantation , the patient will no longer have any wind@@ o@@ ws with a heart pu@@ mp or instructions .
it will only be left with ro@@ of@@ s and immun@@ ities .
the patient can do sport and generally live like the ordinary person &apos; , he says .
the first year is the most dangerous .
a sis@@ der added that full recovery will take three to six months .
according to both doctors , the patient must strictly monitor the taking of drugs and , at the same time , the pharmaceutical side effects .
furthermore , the patient must be subject to scrutiny in order to avoid a structural response from the donor group .
the most dangerous one is the first year , but according to IS@@ H@@ L@@ T , or International Soci@@ ety for H@@ ear@@ t and L@@ un@@ g Transparency , over a decade , 50 % of patients already live .
Denmark stated that in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , the results are better and that the long@@ es@@ t-@@ lived heart has been living for 25 years .
Kar@@ di@@ o@@ x@@ ur@@ g explained that , as a result of the illness , the patient &apos;s blood cycle was put on a heart balance a year ago , which helped to recover for operations .
when the man &apos;s emphasis fell , he became a suitable candidate for transplantation .
the monitoring operation is not considered to be a very difficult passage in the T@@ AS : it is very important to have the right timing .
&apos;@@ H@@ e took much more time to get into the pu@@ mp and then get into the heart when you put a new heart in , you say , &apos; .
in addition , the car@@ di@@ o@@ sur@@ ge , as a complex part of the operation , has ex@@ pelled from a body to a blood cycle .
rather , he says that it can be regarded as an extraordinary time , because the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans need it the least .
much more is being done about kid@@ ne@@ y , li@@ ver and l@@ ung transplants .
if there is a rare paragraph , there is an exc@@ iting movement , but we have been ac@@ custom@@ ed to this work for many years .
learning to know its own and its ner@@ v@@ ous system is one art of this Office &apos; , Denmark added .
there are four more people in need of this body .
the patient was told to have a heart , because none of the patients living in a country other than the one in the Community were settled by a body .
steel transport is an organisation for an exchange of organs whose members are Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia .
four more people are currently on the list of sy@@ m@@ me@@ try in Estonia .
&apos;@@ The@@ y patients who are still lo@@ cked up &apos; stressed P@@ y@@ der .
the long@@ es@@ t-@@ waiting , according to the sun , is for the big men with a w@@ 0-@@ positive ve@@ reg@@ ru@@ p .
&apos;@@ Finland has a qu@@ e@@ ue for this for about half a year &apos; , he said .
there are also some conditions for cat@@ ching up .

it makes a special focus on love fil@@ ms .
the programme also contains fil@@ ms which represent a to@@ wer of love , both new urban works and an old good class .
numerous special events in many places make a week of a university city a film .
all fil@@ ms are free for visitors , there are up to 1 500 seats , and this year there is an area covered directly to the scre@@ en in front of an artificial up@@ he@@ aval , which creates a situation for the town centre on a temporary basis .
in the largest stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket of Europe in Switzerland , the film can enjoy 8 000 visitors at the same time .
the Lo@@ car@@ no film f@@ esti@@ val will be the centre of Pi@@ az@@ za G@@ ran@@ de , or Great S@@ qu@@ are , between 2 and 12 August .
within the framework of the f@@ esti@@ val , there are many representa@@ tions chaired by recognised re@@ ga@@ si@@ d@@ ers and parts .
as we arrive at a balance of law , payments of EUR 15@@ -@@ 20 will have to be lo@@ we@@ red for the enjo@@ y@@ ment of one film .

comparison of the fas@@ test s@@ car pac@@ kets : ec@@ Ã¶@@ club tic@@ kets out of sa@@ u@@ ari@@ a@@ th@@ ms .
the consumer of the Po@@ sch@@ ol@@ ar compared the most favourable packages offered by s@@ car@@ ves to one person for a single night on 11 and 12 August .
&apos;@@ S@@ pa@@ ob@@ ho@@ tels are different levels and choice of service , so one comparison is very difficult to make on price alone &apos; , Mr Sa@@ u , the head of sales of the C@@ IS T@@ our@@ s .
compared to s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated accommodation accommodation , it turns out that prices for the most favoured packages vary several times , and that options are available both to the more demanding custom@@ er and to the more modest wishes of the bu@@ ff@@ er .
for example , if a passenger alone , from EUR 51 , V@@ Ã¤@@ l@@ ska S@@ pa Par@@ k in a single seat of the water centre in the house of bu@@ ff@@ et@@ -@@ air and break@@ fast , and in the un@@ restricted use of water par@@ k , power and sa@@ ils , a package of EUR 2@@ 87 per person will have to be evaluated as part of the P@@ Ã¤@@ d@@ land concept .
it contains accommodation in the category D@@ ou@@ ble D@@ ar@@ a@@ x@@ e , the break@@ fast resta@@ ur@@ ant Alexander winter , and a &apos; load and a half-@@ day &apos; package .
by choosing and compar@@ ing different packages , consideration should be given to the fact that , in order to obtain the most favourable price , a holiday should go to a friend or a com@@ ma , because two k@@ ids of night will be more fav@@ oura@@ bly than taking an individual do@@ g .
however , if there is a desire to han@@ g on its own , there are two extra tobacco available to the vis@@ it@@ or , both for special one-@@ person tobacco and for the premi@@ um .
if , in general , the un@@ accompanied passenger simply has to pay a couple of extra charges for being alone in two , then compromises will also make it possible to find more favourable options .
for example , the F@@ R@@ A M@@ are T@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ as package at a one-@@ stop shop of EUR 86 , but if they so wish , a more favourable opportunity is also offered to mar@@ ch in two parts , provided that , in the event of a lack of space , someone else is se@@ ated in advance by informing the custom@@ er .
in that case , the package will have to be evaluated at EUR 58 .
it is worth being flexible in order to have the most favourable di@@ am@@ on@@ ds .
package prices are dynamic , that is to say , depending on day and day after week .
in the &apos; most favourable package , prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 &apos; , Mr Tri@@ in@@ u , the chair of the T@@ ar@@ en@@ e , explained their pricing policy .
he also drew attention to the fact that in their ho@@ tels the price is changing , depending on the he@@ ight , and added that normally the custom@@ er gets the best price , boo@@ king directly their website or asking their own supply .
since the summer period is the most rapid , leave is worth planning in good time to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold .
for example , only s@@ vic@@ ts have been selected on 11 August , both in S@@ p@@ as , as well as in S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa and conference ho@@ tel , and in the case of Vienna , where packages have been compared .
you do not need to look a long way to spend an opportunity to brea@@ the leave : almost every major town in Estonia will find one , or indeed several , s@@ mi@@ les .
at the same time , it is worth investigating before buying the package , and at the same time there are no major events in the vic@@ in@@ ity , as it will push prices up straight away .
for example , the Val@@ ge da@@ m events are taking place in The Hague between 11.@@ 13 and 13 August .
at that time , the health gap is very high for tourists , the demand for accommodation places and we are at the same time at the prices of the major events .
&apos;@@ so , at that time , we do not have accommodation in the sale at a preferential price or a favourable package &apos; , commen@@ ted on the wave of a s@@ car@@ ho@@ tel President I@@ ren@@ e Pri@@ or .
&apos;@@ De@@ vel@@ ling American &apos; under &apos; black break &apos; .

Ka@@ ta@@ mar@@ a@@ an , but it is c@@ rus@@ hed .
what formula should this increase in air ?
let us , however , save ourselves ( it is not difficult to find it ) and cast a look at the concept of &apos; cle@@ arance &apos; as a simple farmer .
why do aircraft remain in the air ?
the form of the w@@ ings is that , if an aero@@ plane dri@@ ves ahead at a high speed , the air flow@@ ing from the w@@ ings and across the board , because of the difference of emphasis , at some point it is going to over@@ load the air and it will ease the whole mass .
in essence , the same process is taking place in water .
it is true that , as we move forward at a high speed , the force is increasing , and that , in turn , is what emer@@ ges from the fault of the &apos; ch@@ er@@ ished &apos; .
is it simple ?
it is difficult to get to the figures .
a plane needs a minimum of 15@@ 0-@@ 250 kilometres per hour for air , a world record of the wind@@ s is &apos; only &apos; 12@@ 1.@@ 1 km / h .
however , let us not become bo@@ gged down in secondary school &apos;s physi@@ cs .

NA@@ C@@ R@@ A comes together on the key signs of Nor@@ th@@ -@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an Ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an R@@ ac@@ ting Association .
the F@@ CS is a short distance from F@@ li@@ gh@@ t Con@@ tro@@ l S@@ y@@ ste@@ m .

in London , however , he met his first hus@@ band , the roots of J@@ ama@@ ica Mon@@ ty@@ t , with whom they opened up in 196@@ 4 in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , the easy place of feed in The J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an Ho@@ use .
ten years later , the marriage broke down and the resta@@ ur@@ ant closed the doors .
in 197@@ 6 , he already opened a resta@@ ur@@ ant of Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e , a resta@@ ur@@ ant intended for a somewhat more prosperous nation , at R@@ es@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , which was one of the highest feed places for the next 21 years in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
a resta@@ ur@@ ant of March is still being talked about as the first place of F@@ ine d@@ in@@ ing in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , which really can value fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be the truth of the air , but at the end of the last century it was not at all .

the book first appeared in 1996 , the revised output in 2004 and the latest version in 2014 .
in my libr@@ ary , this is something which takes quite a lot of room for the early 2004 , because in the im@@ post@@ ons there are about a thousand reci@@ tals on 1@@ 12@@ 6 pages !

Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e himself emphasises that it was this book that changed his life and provided a new direction for future activities .

R@@ AS@@ M@@ US M@@ Ã¤@@ g : the preparation has not gone quite as I saw in enthusiasm .
&apos;@@ J@@ ust not everything has been as I saw in mind &apos; , says about the training that prece@@ ded M@@ Ã¤@@ g M@@ M@@ M@@ M .
on Re@@ e@@ de@@ l-@@ Saturday , there are important moments that show how the body is accurate .
and competition in any case demonstrates what we are looking for here .
today , I believe that my preparation has been of high quality in both this year and in previous years , so that it is possible to run normally on all of this .
something special on Sunday , according to the Est@@ onian era , M@@ Ã¤@@ g after the National Ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ships has not been working on the ground of 13@@ .@@ 05 .
in recent weeks , there are often too many tra@@ in@@ ers .
there should be a warning , and it could be very useful that the last M@@ -@@ last week was a little easier .
on the physical side , the days of the start are as follows : yesterday , a tru@@ ck of the pu@@ ppe@@ t , today makes a war@@ ring trend .
however , he does not want to be very ang@@ ry in his spiri@@ tual preparation : &apos; if I have a long period of time with my ru@@ ti@@ lines .
there is a lot of quiet and peace , and I will not let the head@@ lines any rosÃ© music .
I do not need to look at any motiva@@ ting vi@@ de@@ os or to read su@@ ici@@ des , but to be here and , at that moment , to assess the possibility that spor@@ ts@@ men across the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place .
this in itself creates a special character .
the m@@ m is , of course , a year of pea@@ k for every fri@@ vol@@ or , and M@@ Ã¤@@ g is every pre-@@ instal@@ ment , including in T@@ em@@ on@@ t@@ species , having tried a few technical nu@@ ances , compared with a few con@@ ting@@ ents .
there is no possibility of experim@@ en@@ ting in the transplant con@@ test any more .
&apos;@@ The aim here is simply to run quickly &apos; , speaks M@@ Ã¤@@ g , but adds that , if the pre@@ matu@@ rity and potentially also the semi@@ -@@ final can make a me@@ al or a couple of energy reserves , then they will definitely benefit from the next drin@@ k .
for the first time , the Central Party will go to the elections with the foun@@ der of the party and the ideological cornerstone .
so far , we have said the Central Party and we were thinking of Sa@@ ve or the other way round .
it is now up to the Federal Party to find a way out .
in doing so , they also need to lo@@ cate the party &apos;s col@@ ours , sometimes criminal and embarras@@ sing past , between supporters of the Sa@@ x@@ ony parties and the voters and expectations of the Sa@@ ve parties .
the departure of Sa@@ x@@ ony puts the Central Party in the most difficult ideological situation .
on the basis of past political practice and ideology , it can be said that the old n@@ in@@ as@@ vi@@ k is playing them firmly .
a number of ma@@ ps that have previously had a kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on effect may not this time materi@@ alise .
the P@@ op@@ ul@@ is@@ m@@ ik@@ a@@ t for the Middle East is not working , because Sa@@ va@@ g@@ ar can always be allowed more than the Prime Minister &apos;s party .
playing on the Russian map is aggra@@ vated by the position of the Central Party in government and also because here , too , we are seeing gas sin@@ k by the so-called Sa@@ vin@@ o@@ va electoral union .
the patient &apos;s card is already in the Sa@@ ve po@@ cket as a result of the ongoing trial .
for the Central Party , the People &apos;s Gu@@ ard and the poor have also disappeared an insul@@ ting card .
the first of these is the c@@ rus@@ hing of this un@@ valuable and second stronger game being held up by the coalition partners in government .
however , one card could be even more important .
all the last elections have confirmed that it is the political parties that are able to formulate and implement the basic electoral structure .
at the very least , the main building block has shif@@ ted around Sa@@ x@@ ony .
if some political parties were to gain the idea of brea@@ the life into a well-@@ functioning confrontation , the Middle East card package is once again lacking .
what is left to the Central Party then ?
a strong party appar@@ atus and a considerable resource are in them .
there will also be enough cl@@ ou@@ ds in the run-up to the elections .
the self-@@ advertise@@ ment of four years ago with taxpayers &apos; money is now , I hope , re@@ paid by the majority of children .
there is still a city city city city city in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , but the cultivation of the party gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ as is even lower there .
in addition , the party has voice ma@@ go@@ ds .
their role will be to put them out of the fire at the tan@@ ks this time , because the image of the ruling party is not sufficient to moti@@ vate voters in a meaningful way .
in ideological terms , Mr Ra@@ ta@@ s must find his way , because the journey with sa@@ tu@@ ration ended in this week .
the tal@@ ent in the Hol@@ k@@ u@@ t Weber : the man cra@@ cked into a foreign car on the train .
last night , at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , the police met a somewhat sel@@ fish challenge .
indeed , a ow@@ ner of the Au@@ di announced that in a tan@@ ker at Por@@ t Ar@@ tur@@ i , someone was a stran@@ ger in his car and be@@ er .
the pat@@ rol@@ s that responded to the event found the man who , when he arri@@ ves , f@@ itted up to business .
indeed , the man on his journey was ti@@ red for a moment and found a place in the back seat of an ali@@ en man .
&apos;@@ The man , apart from the removal of the law enforcement on his own way again &apos; , describes the Western pre@@ ser@@ t in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k .

the most stu@@ p@@ id questions to be put to the ba@@ r .
Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st bro@@ ws issues that have reached the ba@@ r &apos;s head@@ lines , which they would not like to hear more easily .
what drin@@ k can you do best ?
in some drin@@ ks , there are indeed more ingredients than in others , but in order to produce them , the same skills and skil@@ l are needed .
the ba@@ r services often interpret this question as &apos; W@@ hat is the e@@ asi@@ est / fas@@ test to prepare for the summer at the moment ? &apos; which signals to them that the custom@@ er has whatever he drin@@ ks , whether to make it difficult or not for the ba@@ r .
what drin@@ k do you love best ?
this question is interpreted in the same way as to what sort of co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il would be the e@@ asi@@ est to get away from the ba@@ r at the moment .
that is not the case for the credit@@ or to say , but the custom@@ er makes the decisions itself according to the pla@@ tes of his own w@@ alle@@ ts .
rather , the ba@@ r question would be asked whether there are any special offers at the moment .
what is good here ?
perhaps there is a genuine desire behind this question to find out whether the ba@@ r is distingu@@ ishing with any offers other than that , but it could be asked otherwise .
nor can the ba@@ r foresee what the custom@@ er might prefer at all .
would I have a drin@@ k that would not be very swe@@ pt ?
there is a rule , just like the previous one , that the ba@@ r does not know the tas@@ te and the advantages , and that , for one thing , is not necessarily the case for the others .
however , he is prepared to listen to the tas@@ te that the do@@ gs are supposed to contain .
will this drin@@ k cause me a hea@@ da@@ che / po@@ ph@@ mel@@ l ?
in front of the b@@ os@@ ses , the media are not a fo@@ recas@@ ter to know that custom@@ er , have no hand in heart .
the police will seek the Est@@ onian sun according to the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .

the Belgian officials already knew in June about the contamination of eggs .
&apos;@@ We already knew of the possible problems with the pu@@ ppe@@ t p@@ ron@@ i@@ il@@ i at the beginning of June , K@@ at@@ ri@@ en S@@ tra@@ gi@@ er V@@ R@@ T , spokes@@ person for the Belgian Office for Food Safety , said in religious terms .
we immediately started an investigation and we also spoke to the Pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s office , because it could have been a fraud .
there was an investigation that was made secret .
we understand that people have health issues and we are trying to answer them &apos; , Annex Sta@@ gi@@ er .
the news agency A@@ F@@ P tried , in recent days , to get information from the prosecu@@ tor who is involved , but it did not say anything , because the investi@@ ga@@ tive judge banned the publication of information .
the derivatives have been withdrawn from the market as a precautionary measure in Belgium until the results of the analyses become clear .
millions of Dutch eggs that have been withdrawn from the marketing in the Netherlands and Germany .
the German Minister for Agriculture , Chris@@ ti@@ an Schmidt , has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to bring clarity to the matter quickly .
&apos;@@ somebody has clearly pollu@@ ted the eggs in a criminal manner with a banned product &apos; , said Bil@@ d to the German newspaper .
according to the opinion of the Est@@ onian L@@ ine and Food Agency ( V@@ TA ) , the eggs produced by pesticides in the Netherlands are probably not in Estonia .
&apos;@@ We know that Dutch eggs in Estonia are not &apos; , the V@@ TA press spokes@@ man , Martin Al@@ tra@@ ja B@@ N@@ S , said .
he added that there are also no products produced from other Dutch eggs in Estonia .
according to the Sta@@ tis@@ tical Office , eggs from the Netherlands in Estonia have not been imported in the last 10 years .
most recently , Dutch eggs were brought to Estonia in 2006 .
the Dutch authorities suspect that pesticides on fi@@ p@@ ron@@ g reached chic@@ k@@ ens as a result of the Dutch company Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ n &apos;s attempt to cure the chic@@ ken suffering .
reports from the Dutch and Belgian media that a substance containing pesticides reached Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ end@@ ini via a Belgian company have not yet been approved .
in large quantities , the fi@@ p@@ ron@@ age , as the World Health Organisation reports , is moder@@ ately dangerous and may have a negative impact on people , particularly children , kid@@ ne@@ ys , pay and a kil@@ ler face .
how do you stand up if you try to get a child ?

this may happen to any couple trying to pregnant .

women often feel unable to enjoy the &apos; ordinary &apos; cycle at the end of the cycle when it is known that there will be no positive outcome .
this is causing tensions , which in turn will lead to a reduction in sex and less sex will , of course , mean an even greater chance of not being pregnant .
however , men feel that they must be able to &apos; exist &apos; if they are required to do so .
if you know your fer@@ tile days , it can be good for you to plan something ro@@ man@@ tic with more de@@ arly .
be it a special din@@ ner or just spend time together - enjoy each other !
take the fruitful period into account .
from the point of view of ref@@ ou@@ le@@ ment there is absolutely no point in mi@@ xing when cha@@ u@@ vin@@ ism has taken place , but in order for your couple to flou@@ rish , try to f@@ ool a few days after the fru@@ it@@ less days .
although there is no proof that contra@@ ception takes place more firmly than that of a woman &apos;s or@@ g@@ as@@ m , it does not forget it !
let us remember that each couple is different .
everyone will be able to do things differently to the be@@ e-@@ making stress .
some men want to be aware of the cycle of a woman , while others prefer not to know that they would not feel pres@@ su@@ ri@@ sed to &apos; demand &apos; .
no one knows you better than yourself how you are best suited .
find your solution .
studies have shown that a higher degree of success is the case for couples who are sex every few days , but not every couple can keep such den@@ sity .
the most important thing is to find a pat@@ tern that is best suited to you as a couple .
the 10 in@@ ex@@ or@@ able advertising j@@ un@@ k , which makes the appearance of food more attractive .
as many foods are hard to look , the picture uses a very different component which de@@ ters people - rather than milk , for example , a li@@ tre of po@@ ta@@ to@@ e or po@@ ta@@ to@@ es .
the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be Can@@ to@@ p T@@ r@@ end@@ ing provides an in@@ sight into which tri@@ cks are quite common in the world of advertising .
if someone opens a po@@ ph@@ as@@ k in advertising or takes out of a box of a box of h@@ amb@@ ur@@ ger , a number of s@@ on@@ g@@ s of it will emerge .
in reality , the bu@@ tter is longer and , throughout this period , the cu@@ m of food is not immun@@ e , because the h@@ ire comes from a high blood content , which , for example , has not been produced in the timber products .
therefore , bot@@ tom@@ -up cotton cotton has been set up in packaging or food , which has the capacity to absor@@ b and preserve our own water .
in the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity , they are respec@@ tful for much longer than Bur@@ ger or po@@ p@@ cor@@ n and the product is kno@@ w@@ led@@ ge@@ able .
the Car@@ t@@ na@@ der is a great ab@@ stra@@ ct for photo@@ graph@@ s , because it will not be mel@@ ting in the hands of lies or heat and will not make a significant difference to con@@ ven@@ ten@@ ts such as many other food products .
for example , instead of a cre@@ w or a ro@@ of po@@ lar bears or ice man@@ tle , it can be a car@@ na@@ ge .
od@@ d col@@ ours and declar@@ ative elements , and the consumer has been dece@@ ived yet again .
the Li@@ im re@@ places milk .
it is not easy to look at milk , either , because it might not be so white at all on the back of the pho@@ to .
in addition , foodstuffs produced with milk will quickly become l@@ Ã¶@@ n within it .
since , for example , the morning b@@ ands or s@@ wind@@ le have to look in milk clothing and s@@ lee@@ ping , instead of milk , a comp@@ ound is being used that is not going through any gene@@ ro@@ sity .
if resta@@ ur@@ ants are able to make a lot of effort to produce meat in order to produce the result from the volume and from the bottom up , it will not be done by advertising .
however , it is precisely the meat presented in advertising that looks particularly attractive , as if it has come directly from the g@@ ri@@ l .
however , it is often pic@@ ked up on the ban@@ ner or being done in gre@@ ed , and the g@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ ling tri@@ bes are pul@@ ling on the meat with sho@@ es other than c@@ in@@ em@@ a .
it is just as difficult to work with disability as it is with ice , because it ten@@ ds to be mel@@ ting .
fortunately , there is a product that is almost identical in the field of wh@@ ale to a wh@@ ale - a tra@@ w@@ ling lea@@ f .
it could , therefore , be in advertising for bo@@ ys or mar@@ ches or within milk co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il .
even on the surface of the fruit sold in the shops , there may be a stra@@ w la@@ yer that makes their appearance more attractive .
however , that is not enough for the fo@@ to , and it is the de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant who will be s@@ pra@@ yed to add the cotton threshold .
the as@@ th@@ ma is also not very fo@@ ge@@ tic because , in time , they will become liqu@@ ids or will , for example , be released into water .
here , however , we need to resort to a gu@@ n whose private col@@ ours and more permanent television make it possible to make attractive pa@@ int stri@@ pp@@ ers .
the cl@@ oud is probably also used on those pic@@ tures where mel@@ ting cho@@ col@@ ate runs on a co@@ g or ice .
when you look at a code with ide@@ ally im@@ pa@@ ired pas@@ sa@@ ges in advertising , where the b@@ is@@ tu@@ n relationship is perfect , there are probably some extra la@@ yers or pieces of paper being used .
this is because you can break this code and break the picture .
if , after being cut off the ca@@ ke and s@@ pra@@ ying them with perfec@@ tion , it leaves a rather aw@@ k@@ ward impression .
a couple and a n@@ ight@@ m@@ are are also used inside the bur@@ g@@ ger to put all the ingredients there in place in order to keep them in the place of beau@@ ty .
that is why Mr Bur@@ ger &apos;s sentence does not look like advertising .
paper is an aw@@ k@@ ward chic@@ ken .
in advertising , pri@@ z@@ es and A@@ us@@ tri@@ ans look out of ju@@ ir , but it may not even be ready for matu@@ rity .
to add an adult &apos;s impression , a full piece of paper is being pac@@ ked , if necessary , it will be bu@@ ried before this po@@ ta@@ to has been mentioned , and then it will just be s@@ pra@@ yed to bro@@ wn with a col@@ oured colour .
P@@ ann@@ als are po@@ ison@@ ed , particularly in American advertising , with a tra@@ der transplant , because this picture gives rise to a great deal of publi@@ city in people .
in fact , the sc@@ ram@@ ble into the transplant do@@ se quickly and the flow of a transplant dis@@ appears quickly on the label of photo@@ graph@@ s .
therefore , every ban@@ ner is being s@@ pra@@ yed through a cle@@ ans@@ ing instrument for diesel , which will help prevent rapid inf@@ il@@ tration .
it is often not helpful , either , and so the gol@@ den engine oil that is po@@ ised and presented as a transplant is resor@@ ted to .
in U@@ 18 Est@@ onian in the semi@@ -@@ final h@@ ul@@ l , the best of Britain and the A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ om@@ p did not get .
the match started at an extremely rapid rate and the first quarter won by the British in five ( 18 : 23 ) many re@@ funds were thrown .
in the second quarter , the difference increased still further and the rest break break break was min@@ i in the n@@ ine-@@ point success of visitors ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia was able to win the third quarter , but only on one point .
the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans died before the last 10 minutes there was an eigh@@ t-@@ point ( 46 : 54 ) .
the fourth quarter bot@@ ched Estonia &apos;s game in full and , in the end , the lo@@ opho@@ le with the figures had to be lo@@ we@@ red with 61 : 75 .
the loss c@@ rus@@ hed the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans &apos; hopes of reaching the A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ om@@ p , because only two of the best concentra@@ tions can get there .

the leaders of the regions of the Central Party across Estonia made an appeal to the public and to the political parties , which calls for votes in favour of the Central Party and not of electoral associations .
above all , this message is addressed to those who are considering E@@ D@@ A@@ R Sa@@ va@@ go@@ s between the electoral union and the Central Party .
we struck the answer to An@@ si@@ pi@@ le : we have done a great deal for Estonia &apos;s success .
the Vice-President of the European Commission , And@@ r@@ us An@@ si@@ p , in an inter@@ view to Kroes , said that he was sad@@ den@@ ed to look at Estonia &apos;s day-to-day policy , because the J@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ s Government has just and un@@ predictable the tax system on its head .
the press took the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia &apos;s success and what I can be proud of .
I am delighted that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team and with the months we read , many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than 10 years , have been written in the social media today .
according to the Ra@@ level , these decisions are , for example , a reform of the tax on people &apos;s incomes , a pension reform to ensure a decent retirement age for the elderly , a reform of the municipalities to balance the development of Estonia , an increase in agricultural aid for rural recovery and , of course , a health reform to provide accessible and high-quality medical care .

it is worth knowing : how do we calcu@@ late how much sugar is in dairy products ?
&apos;@@ Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the European Union &apos;s food labelling standards , the packaging can indicate the quantity of car@@ b@@ ons and sugar , which , however , does not coinci@@ de at all with the white , the &apos; board of des@@ ks &apos; , confirmed V@@ ali@@ o Estonia &apos;s marketing director , K@@ ris@@ ta Kal@@ b@@ in .
according to him , dairy products are in practice three types of sugar : the lit@@ mus test in milk , the natural dairy co@@ ff@@ ers , the fruit g@@ l@@ l@@ co@@ se and f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s , and an added sugar or sa@@ ha@@ ro@@ s .
however , bearing in mind a few simple basic tru@@ ths , the calculation of the amount of sugar included in the product contained in Kal@@ b@@ in should not make it difficult .
first of all , it must be made clear whether it is milk or milk products that have been s@@ tun@@ ned .
in normal milk and milk oo@@ ks there are about 5 grams of a ba@@ r of milk pow@@ der , or a co@@ in of 100 grams per product .
in the dairy products that have been used in the milk sector , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ tic or ke@@ p@@ aste bac@@ teri@@ a have been a part of the final product during the process of w@@ rap@@ ping , which has resulted in an average of 3.@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g of shar@@ ned dairy products .
in order to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar added , it is the first to rec@@ la@@ i@@ m the total of sugar at the ce@@ re@@ p@@ per , in Kal@@ b@@ in .
now it is the f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and the g@@ lu@@ e of the bot@@ tles and fru@@ its that have to be calculated in the sugar collected .
&apos;@@ generally speaking , for f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and g@@ lu@@ e milk products , in normal 3-@@ 4 % of grain content is ca 0.@@ 3 grams and , in particular , in the mar@@ vel@@ le of 15 % of the crop content in products with a content of up to 1.5 grams &apos; , said Kal@@ b@@ in .
according to him , this simple calculation shows that the amount of sugar added can be up to twice as much as the proportion of sugar specified on the packaging .
in the case of non-@@ food products , the situation is slightly different , as they are subject to sugar content depending on production technology .
a 10-@@ year-old man ju@@ mped off a plane .
during World War II , S@@ t Ver@@ du@@ n Ha@@ ys has recently received a military prize to mark a water@@ shed which has broken the world record .
indeed , in 10@@ 1 years and 38 days from the age of age , the man committed an army , thus sending the oldest sub@@ prime minister to a person in the world .
in antici@@ pation of the emissions of the air , is Ger@@ d K@@ an@@ ter making the history of M@@ M@@ M ?
the current m@@ ood is in eight places for K@@ an@@ ter , none of its con@@ gl@@ ory in London has achieved this kind of achievement .
moreover , the K@@ an@@ ter is the only re@@ distribu@@ tor in history that has won a full set of me@@ dal@@ s ( gold , two sil@@ ver and two p@@ ron@@ ges ) from M@@ M@@ ale .
today ( 5 August 201@@ 7 ) , K@@ an@@ ter 38 years and 92 days are old .
if the past turns itself into a tw@@ of@@ old world champi@@ on@@ ist , it will be the oldest he@@ f@@ ist who has won the M@@ M@@ il &apos;s gol@@ d@@ ik@@ ta@@ t .
the Polish army has a similar option , P@@ j@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ac@@ ho@@ w@@ ski@@ l ( 34 years and 60 days old ) .
other exc@@ iting facts :
more than one time , spor@@ ts@@ men from only two countries have come to the World C@@ et@@ ter .
in Germany , there are nine gol@@ den weeks , Lithuania has two .
the World C@@ up record belongs to V@@ ir@@ gi@@ li@@ na Alex@@ na &apos;s name , which is 7@@ 0.@@ 17 in Hel@@ sin@@ ki ( 2005 ) .
the lowest result that has been won is 6@@ 6.@@ 20 - it is in R@@ ie@@ ves ( 199@@ 1 ) .
why do the do@@ gs seem to be breaking ?
sometimes it is thought that a do@@ g will eat a lot if he does not feel well and wants to k@@ ick himself .
in fact , the vast majority of the edi@@ ble do@@ gs are completely healthy .
just under 10 per cent of the co@@ ff@@ ers who seem to be breaking out because of a few diseases .
one of the reasons why a do@@ g can suddenly start to eat a break may be nutri@@ ent foodstuffs .
those do@@ gs , who have faith , can take a greater interest in the face of a break .
therefore , if the do@@ g , who has not bur@@ st in the past , has suddenly emerged from the up@@ side of the whe@@ at and is often eating it , it would be worth going back to the doctor in case to get quickly to gri@@ ps with the problem of s@@ om@@ a@@ dic organs , for example .
it is worth pointing out that a do@@ g may be eating a blow also because he likes that tas@@ te or he is just b@@ oring .
if the health problem is excluded , it would be worth as@@ cer@@ tain@@ ing that the family &apos;s dilemma can still be sufficiently developed and inc@@ isi@@ ve .
over 200 people were employed by the police during the We@@ e@@ p .
in the town of P@@ Ã¤@@ r@@ t , more than 20 crimes were recorded in the days of f@@ esti@@ val .
there is reason to associ@@ ate about half of them with a bar@@ ic@@ a@@ ture , to have a large quantity of nar@@ co@@ tic substances registered alongside the use of violence , and to have two drin@@ k driving .
the mis@@ appropri@@ ation started by the Sa@@ hel was mainly linked to the consumption of alcohol by minors or the possession of banned substances .
a letter was written in a the@@ ft and in a breach of public order .
police stations brought more than 200 people for various reasons .
about half of them were minors , and mostly the police station was the cause of alco@@ hol@@ ism .
there were more minors than half of the boo@@ t in the soil .
half a hundred people were also taken into consideration , just as much as they did last year .
the former head of the police station , And@@ res S@@ human er , is expected in view of the large numbers mentioned above the crow@@ d .
as in previous years , we had thoroughly prepared for the weekend this year .
we have included additional requirements from the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , police missions and aid officers from elsewhere in order to ensure a readiness to react quickly .
most situations were resolved by word and sufficient communication of law enforcement with citizens .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou may have missed a few an@@ tag@@ on@@ ies , because the police in the city had to see and feel enough , in our esti@@ mation , &apos; S@@ humanity spoke .
his opinion was extremely positive that minors who had been fed alcohol were obviously less attractive , and young people proved that they could be ca@@ red for .
he commen@@ ted on the top level team in the security company , who looked after safety in the f@@ esti@@ val .
I would like to thank all the f@@ esti@@ val supporters who thought themselves up poli@@ tely and held the brak@@ es safely .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me also thank the local people , who , with their understanding of the success of the G@@ rand P@@ esti@@ val , contributed &apos; , a poli@@ ce@@ man was appointed .
in the t@@ reas@@ ure police stations , the owners are waiting at the weekend for the town and the moun@@ tains found in the f@@ esti@@ val .
An@@ n@@ ika P@@ Ã¤@@ l@@ na , the head of the company An@@ n@@ ika P@@ Ã¤@@ l@@ na , who was responsible for re@@ serving the stock in the province , had lost pi@@ pes less than the surface this year .
in the Fle@@ mis@@ h police section , more than half of the current payments were made to owners .
most of all , during three days , bank cards , identity documents , mobile phones and techniques have been abolished .
&apos;@@ A@@ t present , the ow@@ ner is still waiting for 13 mobile phones , three b@@ ag@@ s , lap@@ top@@ s , cle@@ ver and several car bu@@ yers &apos; , listed as P@@ Ã¤@@ l@@ na .
in Latvia , the most non-@@ citizens live in D@@ au@@ ga@@ v@@ pil@@ s , Ri@@ ia and Li@@ e@@ pa@@ ta .

outside the major cities , people without Latvian nationality live the most in Je@@ ka@@ b@@ pil@@ s ( 2@@ 3@@ 47 ) and Val@@ mi@@ er@@ as ( 12@@ 35 ) .
at the beginning of 201@@ 7 , 2@@ 42 5@@ 60 people in Latvia did not enjoy Latvian citizenship .

in the United States , two elite university employees were arrested on the basis of a national hun@@ t .
a 4@@ 2-@@ year-old Nor@@ th@@ west Professor W@@ y@@ nd@@ ha@@ m La@@ the@@ m brought himself up to the police in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia when he was sought by the police .
however , the staff of Andre@@ w W@@ ar@@ ren@@ i , a 5@@ 5-@@ year-old university , received police officers in San Transparency .
men are suspected of being cru@@ el@@ ly filled by T@@ ren@@ ton Cor@@ n@@ ell@@ -@@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ a@@ u of 26 years .
he found the death of La@@ th@@ em@@ i in Ch@@ ic@@ ago at the end of last month .
a few days later , in cash under the name of the death of the suspects , a major donation was made to a libr@@ ary .
before hand@@ ing himself into the police , La@@ th@@ am was sent to friends and family members by a staff of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago police , according to whom a video was sent to the greatest blood of life .
the CN@@ N video did not see and the police do not publish it .
according to the police , this was a brutal murder and his body had been immun@@ e by w@@ ounds .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n had recently arrived from Great Britain Ch@@ ic@@ ago , but the investi@@ g@@ ators have not yet as@@ cer@@ tain@@ ed whether and how he was familiar with the victim .
before arrest , both suspects fled the state .
in A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an waters , 3 US na@@ val personnel were lost in an air accident .
the US na@@ val force and the na@@ val army stopped se@@ arching operations , reported the vessel vessel vessel base in the Cam@@ p Bu@@ tle@@ r Sta@@ tement in Japan , basically confir@@ ming that the army will no longer find the disappe@@ aran@@ ces alive .
the accident happened with the na@@ val na@@ vy plane O@@ s@@ Pre@@ y M@@ V 22 , which started off tomorrow in R@@ ic@@ har@@ di .
there were 26 people on board the plane , 23 of whom were able to find and save .

the south-@@ west Japan is preparing a ty@@ pho@@ on for the arrival of Nor@@ u .
a large part of south-@@ western Japan , including regions devastated last month by ra@@ in@@ y ra@@ inf@@ all , was preparing on Friday for even more hatred than Ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u , which was one of the strongest stor@@ ms in the world this year and was increasingly close to the main islands of the country .
according to the Me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Office , from the south-@@ west of Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u island in the south and from T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o about 13@@ 50 km from the island of A@@ m@@ am@@ i on Friday , strong wind@@ s and heavy ra@@ inf@@ all are being caught and , in the next 48 hours , it is possible that up to 800 m@@ m sa@@ ints are being hun@@ ted down .
a representative of the Me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Agency said that Norway , which is a kind of fear in the Korean language , would then most probably turn to the North and cru@@ ise the rain to Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u , even though the main sections of the island hit last month by ra@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ s and floods that killed 36 people and left four disappeared , are likely to escape the worst .
&apos;@@ This is an extremely slow , mobile storm &apos; , he added , noting that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding , as there will be plenty of ra@@ inf@@ all in one region over a longer period of time .
Norway , which at one point was a category 5 ty@@ pho@@ on and is a rou@@ tin@@ ely long-@@ distance storm , formed first two weeks ago and dro@@ w@@ ned around the Pacific north before moving to hopes , targeting Japan and weakening its convergence office .
the representative added that , depending on the change of course , Norway can move directly to the guard over Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and then by@@ pass the Japanese H@@ on@@ sh@@ u Islands , but it is still difficult to determine the longer journey .
an aero@@ plane drew in the place of the United States into perfect shape itself .
the pilot led to an in@@ te@@ ri@@ or nation@@ wide flight over the United States and even a bit tra@@ pped on the route .
the air carri@@ er &apos;s data in real time , according to data from the air carri@@ er , indicated that it was not just a straight line or a ro@@ ck , but with the air carri@@ er , which formed an aero@@ plane with one another .
the flight from B@@ O@@ 00@@ 4 Bay , according to the Boeing F@@ iel@@ d airport , which is monitoring air traffic in real time , was fixed at about 15 : 40 on Wednesday , according to the local time .
Boeing 7@@ 8@@ -@@ 8 D@@ re@@ am@@ lin@@ er took the direction of th@@ war@@ ting Mon@@ tan@@ a , Northern Da@@ ko@@ ta and Min@@ nes@@ ta before a sharp change of course and flying to the e@@ de@@ la .
a strange route from the map is a passenger aircraft with two engines .
according to Boeing , the flight is part of the 18-@@ hour &apos; re@@ sili@@ ence &apos; of the aircraft .
&apos;@@ instead of flying with a false pat@@ tern , the testing team were driving the gu@@ ise of their imag@@ ination on a route from which the 7@@ 8@@ -@@ 8 con@@ t@@ ours consis@@ ted of 22 coun@@ ties &apos; , the Boeing Com@@ pan@@ y representative , R@@ T@@ .@@ c@@ om@@ om@@ a , said to R@@ T@@ .@@ c@@ om@@ a .
&apos;@@ D@@ re@@ am@@ lin@@ er &apos; refers to Putin &apos;s S@@ ou@@ n@@ d region , where Boeing &apos;s Com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al Air@@ pl@@ an@@ es home .
it is from northern Mic@@ h@@ ig@@ an@@ u to the Canadian border to South T@@ ex@@ a@@ se@@ n .
there is a room for H@@ un@@ ts@@ vil@@ le in A@@ v@@ am@@ a , in its anne@@ x .
a distance from Boeing to 7 to 8 D@@ re@@ am@@ lin@@ er was introduced in 2009 .
the aircraft will have up to 2@@ 42 passengers and will be able to fly more than 13 600 kilometres .
as the pil@@ ots used ra@@ da@@ r as a personal ro@@ of , the flight attra@@ cted a peripheral interest on the web among aircraft control@@ lers .
some suspect that this is a t@@ reas@@ ure , others once again suggested that it could be a strange coincidence .
a former sol@@ di@@ er was sentenced to prison for murder of a pen@@ sion@@ er suspected of sexual abuse .
a former sol@@ di@@ er was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man who was suspected of being mis@@ treated by his familiar wife .
Richard Cas@@ ti@@ y ( 70 ) was sentenced in June at the Supreme Court of G@@ las@@ go@@ w to David F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i ( 75 ) for his murder in T@@ we@@ ed@@ ban@@ k Ro@@ x@@ bur@@ gh shire in February 201@@ 6 .
judge L@@ ord S@@ um@@ mer called the murder &apos; particularly brutal &apos; , as the victim &apos;s bodies were 14 stor@@ ms .
a defence lawyer , Brian Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e , said that the killing was caused by &apos; current ma@@ dness &apos; , but he described the facts as &apos; extraordinary &apos; .
Cas@@ si@@ y heard that F@@ ar@@ is@@ h had been sexu@@ ally abused by a woman for a long time .
his lawyer said that he went to F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i home and &apos; am@@ ic@@ able &apos; with him in the hope of receiving evidence and not attempting to kill him .
L@@ ord S@@ um@@ m@@ ers claimed that , on the day of the attack , Cas@@ si@@ y demonstrated signs of intent and referred to a report on social work , which showed that the accused had been trained by military forces on how to inf@@ il@@ tra@@ te through fri@@ end@@ lin@@ ess to a group .
no accusations had been level@@ led at F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i .
it was reported in the court that , after the murder , Cas@@ si@@ y was in contact with the police and brought himself up .
Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e said that the majority of people find it &apos; hard to understand &apos; that Cas@@ it@@ y is capable of murder .
the Defence lawyer said : &apos; he has never had a problem in his life before this incident .
he lived a full life until this moment of dis@@ ma@@ dness in February 201@@ 6 &apos; .
Cas@@ si@@ y &apos;s health is said to be poor and has been hit by heart and disability in custo@@ dy .
according to L@@ ord S@@ um@@ mer@@ si , he took into account , at least 17 years of imprisonment , that Cas@@ ti@@ et@@ i had no prior convictions and what he allegedly said about F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i .
the Scottish police described the case as &apos; a ha@@ p@@ ra older older man &apos;s particularly appalling murder in his own home &apos; .
the investi@@ g@@ ator , David P@@ in@@ k@@ ne@@ y , said : &apos; although this punishment does not make his or her cru@@ el@@ ty , I hope that it will offer a kind of solution to the David family &apos; .
Prime Minister J@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ i has today visited the fourth largest island of Estonia , the island of V@@ or@@ m@@ as , in the framework of a small island , where local leaders and residents met to discuss the topical issues of island life .
the distri@@ ct of V@@ or@@ m@@ s origin@@ ated in the port of S@@ vi@@ by , where the Prime Minister &apos;s wh@@ eel@@ chair was welcome to V@@ or@@ m@@ si val@@ la@@ van@@ em Tan@@ el and the Chairman of the White House , I@@ vo Sar@@ a@@ pu@@ u .
first of all , the historic Church of S@@ t O@@ la@@ vi and the out@@ going fish unique in Estonia in terms of their car@@ cas@@ ses and s@@ on@@ g@@ s .
a study was followed by V@@ or@@ m@@ si &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ -@@ North school , where the Director , A@@ ge H@@ Ã¤@@ l@@ v@@ in , spoke to the Prime Minister about the school &apos;s lifestyle and the teaching order that some of the students from school have a distance to study .
in 2015 , a new and modern operational service unit of the Prime Minister , an additional meeting with the island population , was held .
the debate dealt with important issues for the population , such as the development of airlines and routes between small islands and continent .
the state has undertaken to ensure regular transport connections for fixed small islands , but rising traffic during the summer period , for example , makes important journeys for local residents more difficult .
these are the places where the country can already take local wishes and needs into account in the planning process &apos; , the Prime Minister said .
in addition , issues of construction , interesting education , the safety of the island and rescue capacity were discussed .
today &apos;s V@@ or@@ m@@ si visit was the last part of a visit by Prime Minister &apos;s small island to famili@@ arise the island &apos;s living environment and to discuss the issues to be resolved by local residents and municipalities .
in July , the head of government was ra@@ ided by Sa@@ are@@ land , K@@ i@@ h@@ user , Ru@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ t , Ab@@ ru@@ ka and Vil@@ s@@ and and the island , and in the course of the Man@@ il@@ a@@ da , August , he had visited the Na@@ is@@ tri@@ an Islands , P@@ ran@@ g@@ l and A@@ e@@ g@@ l .
the cold summer has led the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans to travel abroad to the extent that the package journeys are not only expensive , but have been sold regardless of price .
cheap air tic@@ kets and las@@ t-@@ minute tic@@ kets are also not rewar@@ ded ; it is better to think about next year &apos;s travel plans .
at the press conference yesterday , E@@ D@@ G@@ A@@ R Sa@@ x@@ are , a member of the Ri@@ ig@@ ian Assembly that joined the electoral union , Ol@@ ga I@@ van@@ o@@ va , said that the Sa@@ x@@ ony electoral union would provide the Central Party with healthy competition in the elections in T@@ all@@ in@@ n in the autumn .

it always gives the bu@@ tton .
some of our mistakes were not justified , the op@@ pon@@ ent received le@@ is@@ ure and lived on them .
that is what we have done in the past - if we act agg@@ res@@ si@@ vely to protect , there is a risk of over@@ stret@@ ching .
let us learn &apos; , say Re@@ go .

a woman found a stran@@ ger in a was@@ hing machine - to whom would it be ?
&apos;@@ The@@ y started was@@ hing off the machine when the b@@ right between a was@@ hing mas@@ ter in my eye &apos; is spoken by a woman of finding a life of love for her was@@ hing machine .
as a matter of fact , the thres@@ holds in Kar@@ in &apos;s first care of was@@ hing at the door did not pay any attention .
I have set the mas@@ se up again .
&apos;@@ A@@ t the e@@ ars of two small children , the stra@@ ined la@@ undering is created immediately &apos; , the woman is mu@@ zz@@ led .
when the second la@@ yer was passed and I started to pick up the was@@ h , it still remained my head in the eye and then I found the finger there as a kind of b@@ one was@@ hing mach@@ ines .
the name - Tom@@ i - of a man who was mar@@ ried 14 years ago has been ap@@ pra@@ ised as a villa@@ ge of marriage .
as someone in a family with the name of a man or woman who could be in marriage with a few Tom@@ ours does not know , the war is a complete my@@ ster@@ y .
in Kar@@ in looked at the parent from her child that perhaps her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter has been found , po@@ cket and the finger has been thrown out there into a was@@ hing machine , but the child confirmed that she had not brought her finger home .
Kar@@ in has lived a year in the street in T@@ all@@ in@@ n M@@ ad@@ al@@ a , with her fel@@ low@@ ship .
in the past , they were selling it out , and the machine is also coming from that time .
but if the war had anything to do with the ren@@ ts , how did it get into the machine ?
&apos;@@ N@@ o@@ w I am now demanding and cannot understand the route of a journey to a was@@ hing machinery &apos; , a woman is laugh@@ ing .
as the lif@@ ecy@@ cle from the deser@@ t of two small children is quite rapid , it was forgotten that it was first at the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
&apos;@@ recently there have been post@@ ings seeking the ow@@ ner of the gra@@ vity of marriage , and it now seemed that it is high time to look for the ow@@ ner of the screening that he himself has found , refers to a case in the social media where the level of hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ness found in the street in T@@ all@@ in@@ n last week .
&apos;@@ As F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k finds and se@@ arch@@ es for different things , I was the first to try the best there &apos; , speaks Kar@@ in , who has already shared nearly 4 000 people .
&apos;@@ P@@ le@@ ase has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is good &apos; , he risks a woman , indicating that he was advised to take his man on the li@@ ps with the first comments .
then there was the feeling that it was necessary to do so now .
that my man has become the biggest dece@@ it and has been heard of .
to be honest , I was concerned at the beginning , but later , when the comments were made that I myself have been s@@ lee@@ ping with the holder of the war , it is already lau@@ gh .
the Com@@ mis@@ sions also suggested that maybe the po@@ les of the clo@@ th@@ es have reached the end of the day .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , the last six months ago , in a bid to work , one of the other pieces of work was bought that pul@@ led into a machine without more in-depth research , but is it really a woman who talks about the numbers ? &apos;
be that as it may , we have agreed with our partners that now , in principle , we have to find the holder of the war .
let there be no reason to lose that circle .
divorce , family dispute or whatever .
I think that this is the only right thing to do , because if I ever had to disappear in terms of hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ness , I know that I would be most grateful to a person who would try to find me and return a valuable asset .
Kar@@ in has also approached the family status office to get help there .
however , I received the reply that in Estonia , on that date and the name such as Mr mar@@ ried .
one word has been found by the ow@@ ner .
recently , a mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom found in T@@ all@@ in@@ n P@@ el@@ gu@@ ran@@ na on 21 July , the gra@@ vity of which the gra@@ pes were allowed to conce@@ de that it belongs to an elderly woman .
&apos;@@ W@@ ho said to the House at home in the morning , I noticed the outbreak behind the 53 houses of the house , in the in@@ sur@@ moun@@ ted iron , the gol@@ den war &apos; , he says that gra@@ ve@@ ers promised that it belongs to an elderly woman .
Ger@@ li put the fo@@ to the he@@ el ( the pil@@ l ) on his F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k lea@@ k and the group &apos; noticed in T@@ all@@ in@@ n &apos; , distributed information with the town of North T@@ all@@ in@@ na and the North P@@ ec@@ ture .
in two weeks &apos; time , the police conta@@ cted Ger@@ ga and announced that the H@@ igh@@ ter had been identified .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k into the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter of the ow@@ ner and , on Monday evening , the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter went to the gu@@ est &apos; , because the old Mrs had injured her hand and put her finger on the other hand , where it had sli@@ pped down .
&apos;@@ he lost it the same day in the morning when I wal@@ ked with his house &apos; says Ger@@ li .
occasion@@ ally , it is still necessary to be w@@ rap@@ ped , for whatever reason .
however , when the brain between the sk@@ in is han@@ ging , it is time to take one hot road .
there are sufficient resources available for this in the forest .
the home of protection does a small in@@ sight .
what we are talking about is that the co@@ fe@@ ine and the wrong way contain co@@ fe@@ at , which is , to some extent , a virtual act , but is not the best for our health .
the plants found in a free nature must always be ready for testing , because both the prescri@@ ptions and the tas@@ tes are different .
some plants do not need to wait long , just hot water is enough , while others must be left to the hours .
of course , it must also be mind@@ ful that water and plants are clean enough .
it also depends a great deal on the time and place of the clean@@ -up .
let us look more closely at how to prepare some simple roads and what impact they can have on us .

if a day it is a good thing to was@@ h 2 lit@@ res of water , that road will do well to meet the need for C@@ -@@ vita@@ m@@ in and , at the same time , to give some extra energy .
as with all plants , it is also possible to obtain useful elements from the gam@@ ble@@ rs using alternative methods , for example by c@@ rus@@ hing - sho@@ cks do not have to take a long time , hot water will be enough and , for some time , drawing lessons .
for half a li@@ tre of water , it takes 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res of chic@@ k@@ ens , which come for 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k containing nearly 25 m@@ g C@@ -@@ vita@@ mi@@ le , a lot of c@@ ali@@ um and z@@ ine .
in addition , the drin@@ k contains around 1.5 sugar pas@@ sa@@ ges , or S@@ ca 20 k@@ c@@ al sugar .
in order to improve the tas@@ te of the tas@@ te , cohesion and honey can always be added .
and if the drin@@ k got its home , it can be d@@ il@@ u@@ ted like a transplant .
it is the same way to prepare the way for Cuba , but the drin@@ k itself is flav@@ ouring a little differently .
the waiting list is excellent and will help a great deal of w@@ o@@ es , from a journey to a wh@@ is@@ t@@ le .
in the developing world , fa@@ ti@@ gue will help to overcome fa@@ ti@@ gue , will be a pain@@ kil@@ ler file and will help in the case of hospi@@ talis@@ ations , both as a deter@@ rent and as a den@@ i@@ er of the fe@@ ver .
consequently , it is not worth more than half a li@@ tre a day .
the waiting time is also for a s@@ me@@ ll , which is why a more calm moment should be found in winter to be able to enjoy it .
in order to produce a drin@@ k in winter , fresh wh@@ es@@ ts , co@@ ws , networks or br@@ ands will be used in a b@@ ric@@ k wall .
for half a li@@ tre of drin@@ k , you need a bit of a pac@@ k with a lot of time o@@ x@@ ide to be w@@ oo@@ den as long as water becomes a red me@@ al .
there is also a risk of attra@@ cting the v@@ ets .
to do this , the scen@@ es and the ho@@ ves are d@@ run@@ k in a warm water of those hours .
longer and more intensive working is also making the drin@@ k .
a prepared w@@ ar@@ ke@@ k can be added to a foot@@ wear route as well .
Mus@@ c@@ ell@@ -@@ d@@ ol@@ a@@ h
Mus@@ c@@ la@@ d@@ der is a disability that looks like a pat@@ ch@@ work on a pu@@ ppe@@ t in the villa@@ ge .
it is mostly found in the b@@ its , but elsewhere as well .
this area of application is very wide - hot in drin@@ k , fire , virus rather than vi@@ ru@@ m , and so on .
the ash can also be was@@ hed very well .
the path of Mus@@ c@@ oo@@ d@@ k@@ u@@ d@@ k@@ u@@ t is a kind of super@@ drin@@ k that can be used to treat very many diseases , even cancer or len@@ i@@ ency , to raise the tone , to reduce stress , to pro@@ long life expectancy .
Se@@ en contains a number of unique comp@@ ounds and many B@@ -@@ vita@@ mi@@ es , as well as anti@@ o@@ x@@ ities and a little min@@ eral and protein .
roads made from Se@@ en can drin@@ k every day , there is no risk of over-@@ consumption .
in order to run , around 3 x 3 c@@ m of a series will be sufficient , which will be in between 2 and 3 lit@@ res of water for between 5 and 15 minutes .
a woman wal@@ ks wal@@ king around the globe : my day &apos;s budget is USD 5 !
in truth , I have had such experience too , true 40 days in which I decided in southern France to live a &apos; whole@@ sale &apos; life , just to be free and to live on a daily basis .
a ho@@ b@@ by in a tent , a forest , a small town station , etc .
in the second week , I joined a French &apos; hom@@ eless &apos; , 44 year-old men ...
O@@ i , do not think that some pe@@ de@@ si@@ cs v@@ m@@ s : Ã@@ Ã¶@@ b@@ b@@ we just got in the same par@@ k M@@ en@@ ton and we got friends , even though he was 15@@ a parent of me , was a good thing .
it turned out that the man is a great family , a member of Paris , a former officer of the French na@@ vy .
the Al@@ ko@@ t is not wise , the sun does not , in a word , a decent person , an intelligent communication and a pleasant one , a life ...
I joined him and we went back to 3 weeks later , from city to city , and also about 5 to 5 per day .
the money came , as much as it was living .
the man taught us how the a@@ da@@ ge was to provide assistance on closed ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ants &apos; steel and road farms .
we have worked so much to ensure that , for the next 2-@@ 3 days , there would be food for money , and then on ...
at some point , I was a fe@@ ver and decided that it would not be possible to replace ...
I took a flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki , there at home .
and , by the way , I still regret .
those 40 days , I think , were the best in my life .
J@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ gen almost referred to F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k recently : &apos; quo@@ tation is a poor recital &apos; .
therefore , I will not look back and try to recall what has been done in history to re@@ sur@@ rec@@ t the human nature and what results have been achieved .
I will not assess whether these tests can be considered successful or un@@ successful .
I will also avoid excessive reference to sources , although , in a while , I am relying on the idea of my top teacher , T@@ om@@ as Pa@@ ul@@ l , which is that all my thoughts are borro@@ wed from somewhere , if only remember where exactly .
the most striking dynamic of Estonia today is the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion of the citizens of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect person .
we will not grow him like we grow a child - in good faith that he is a person .
we are bringing him up as the ruling class envisaged - which one person must be able to live and speak openly in Estonia .
censorship is perfect .
although the local ruling class changed in part a year ago , some re@@ aring methods are as frigh@@ tening as they were from the previous ruling class , now impover@@ ished addresses - their bru@@ tality does not fall to the least of the previous ones .
they are quite simply different .
Latvia &apos;s be@@ er is the br@@ ink of a new era of vo@@ ter .
0.@@ 5 protest would be mandatory for national leaders .
it is not only the politicians in the ruling class who are paid for their work from the state , but also those who are aware who are doing politics on a voluntary basis ( read : deliberately ) : wri@@ tes by means of opinion pla@@ tes , bo@@ as@@ ting F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k when terrible people around them in Estonia , they are pro@@ pelled , they boycot@@ t , uni@@ for@@ give , sa@@ b@@ o@@ tag@@ ging .
they are only willing to attend EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber ( the English expression of people living in a space where they only have suitable opinions , such as their own friends of F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k etc . ) , but this was not possible in Estonia .
there are still some fellow Members who think or do something that is un@@ be@@ arable for cha@@ u@@ co@@ j@@ ar@@ g@@ ari@@ an .
and that is the logic of the words open and the business cor@@ ners are my@@ ste@@ rious .
we have a great number of politicians who know exactly how many people can che@@ at with whom to s@@ lee@@ p , how many children can work , receive a lot of pay , when you can pu@@ mp what you can think of , how you can break your minds , when you die .
very important points .
if there is anything other than what they have said to their public speeches , they are outra@@ ged , insul@@ ted , hy@@ ste@@ ria .
the fact that in several European countries people are travelling with a &apos; hea@@ ven &apos; car , and this is permitted by law , their opinions are not s@@ hak@@ en .
zero tolerance is the only per@@ missible in every area , but behind zero tolerance there is no care but evil .
class an@@ ger and fa@@ ts - just like me .
politicians can only open ski@@ es , but never mind .
they believe that every &apos; measure &apos; to which they improve society works and is worth trying .
fortunately , they have a glass k@@ it@@ che@@ n under the b@@ el@@ t of adequate size K@@ ar@@ di@@ p , k@@ it@@ che@@ n k@@ u@@ d@@ k@@ u@@ d@@ k@@ u@@ ds with a mental disability who ju@@ mp through every window - without feeling the pain .
for this reason , it seems to us that a cle@@ ver farmer would open up his ski@@ es and he would be be@@ a@@ ten emo@@ tionally by a piece of il@@ lusion that that is what makes sense .
a few words that will certainly send us into a sha@@ m winter are , for example , tomorrow , a refugee , a woman , violence , a job , etc .
to believe everything that self-@@ serving officials , activists and politicians ( such as this are just a small part of all groups , but they can kidna@@ p in such a way that the whole of society compla@@ ins ) talk and wri@@ tes , the citizen is not only an an@@ tag@@ on@@ istic , a v@@ ul@@ gar and an un@@ pleasant one , but also without brain .
but let us not believe , do not tolerate coer@@ ci@@ on , do not prohibit drinking .
an Est@@ onian person will in any case drin@@ k as much as he wants , not as much as the country allows .
an Est@@ onian person will , in any case , tolerate more if he is not forced to tolerate .
the Est@@ onian person will change his behaviour two months before the elections , so that , if the objective is achieved , he or she will turn the back not only into his popul@@ arity , but also to pick up again what un@@ pleasant brain kil@@ ls are rapidly restoring .
anyone else is not the right course .
I do not believe that any person can be re@@ grown .
I believe that you can teach a person .
to drin@@ k your reasonable , love my family , to be a hard-@@ working , poli@@ te , a le@@ is@@ ure fellow , not just for friends , but for society as a whole .
in order to be taught , it is not always necessary to impose fines , limit , ban , force , order , sin@@ k , sin@@ k in the media disgrace .
the teacher must set an example .
a standing politician is talking about the loss of tobacco ?
a poli@@ ce@@ man exceeding speed in free times pun@@ ishes me for speeding ?
and then it will be between the other colleague , the j@@ om@@ le ...
I have such a kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on idea that perhaps we should try to bring the ruling class over again .
to tell them , do not run in secret .
if you drin@@ k , drin@@ k openly : with the pla@@ te of the House of Com@@ m@@ ons , in the eyes of the whole nation .
forcing the motor@@ way to be overcome only openly - the cars of ru@@ lers , private cars , be they all red .
if we are , then govern as you govern yourself .
perhaps the shame will be enough then if words and actions do not go together .
or we will find out that we ourselves want to be governed by those most evil .
because all of us , the pione@@ ers , are what we want not to be at all at all .
where to fle@@ e for themselves ?
this weekend a ra@@ in@@ y will be allowed , so it would be time for a proper trend to be done .
why not tri@@ m@@ ming leg@@ s !
your &apos; R@@ E g@@ or@@ ges &apos; share recommendations for nine habits , which should help us to achieve more secre@@ tly and better at the time .
admittedly , the first changes should be seen after the first tr@@ en@@ n@@ ying !
a bus driver saved eight cu@@ t@@ backs from driving , without knowing that do@@ gs actually have a ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y to which I put these eight months , I would have been thrown out by a woman , along with a do@@ g , by a bus driver O@@ le@@ g , who rescu@@ ed the cam@@ er@@ as around the journey at the border without supervision , hand@@ ing them over to the asylum worker .
soon , however , the ow@@ ner of a do@@ g of refuge became apparent for whom the scen@@ es were taken away from their homes .
the bus driver of Har@@ ju@@ land , O@@ le@@ g , has said that he has been working as a bus driver since the beginning of the 1990s , but such a case has not previously been covered in his career by &apos; W@@ hat I was travelling by bus to 1 4@@ 6 of his normal routes .
close to Har@@ ju@@ -@@ Ris@@ t , I noticed that the road is running around something small .
I thought it was a ba@@ r , but it turned out that there were four c@@ ents &apos; , a bus driver reminded us .
you had a bul@@ l in your hands , and he stopped passengers full of buses in order to fill the w@@ ounds .
&apos;@@ The damage started , the cars would have travelled over them and the do@@ gs had cro@@ ssed them &apos; , the word was O@@ le@@ g .
he added that passengers were sensible and that they were also offered low cost co@@ ff@@ ers with great jo@@ y .
a little fea@@ red at the beginning , but then it became a la@@ x bus .
a bus on board , the bus driver went to a new front because the times@@ c@@ ale needed to be followed .
at the same time , he saw another four small do@@ gs there when he wal@@ ked through an inven@@ tory of she@@ ds .
it was a German lam@@ b co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
they were so immediate and they had to see that they had been looked after .
the do@@ gs were beautiful , even shocking .
the first thought was , of course , that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason &apos; , the bus driver said that , for this reason , he had decided to set up cu@@ rious buses .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k after the four months and called the police &apos; , recalled O@@ le@@ g .
the prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers conta@@ cted the animal shel@@ ter in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , with the workers coming to the tin@@ y Baltic plant .
however , was the bus driver not temp@@ ted to take on a stran@@ ger ?
that was the point .
one of the col@@ os@@ ses was so beautiful and calm .
a beau@@ ty was said by O@@ le@@ g , like a adult ko@@ er .
but where do I put these eight cu@@ t@@ backs in ?
I would have been thrown out by a woman in a cor@@ ner with a do@@ g .
we still have a small child .
to take a b@@ el@@ t still &apos; , he added it .
E@@ ve To@@ bi@@ as , the animal shel@@ ter in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , confirmed that 8 German cu@@ cu@@ mb@@ ers for sheep , who are two and a half months old , were indeed set up for asylum .
but already on the same day , the ow@@ ner had to go to the family of govern@@ ors .
&apos;@@ We did not even put them in and gave them just off &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ The ow@@ ner of the do@@ gs was not very ang@@ ry , but he said , though , that they had the only way of looking the house and the bus driver could have asked whether the scen@@ es belong to them &apos; , was talking about To@@ bi@@ as .
however , the advi@@ ser of asylum added that it is good , at the same time , that the on@@ set of the bus driver has cle@@ ared up the rivers along the way and therefore did not happen with accidents .
in fact , it was very good from the bus driver that he reacted !
the landscape has met where , if necessary , the best will of conventional vehicles simply cannot get .
that is where the solution lies with the A@@ TV .
the A@@ TV , which has been used in a military area , gave an overview of the home of Ka@@ ice !
there is nothing new in the use of such ligh@@ t-@@ weight and good vehicles in military structures .
the need for them has already come up during the Second World War , but more attention has been given to them in a decade later .
simpli@@ city and strength
as early as 195@@ 6 , M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 from W@@ ill@@ ys O@@ ver@@ land factories , known as a me@@ ha@@ an@@ ha@@ an@@ ic mu@@ m@@ ul@@ a , developed from a vehicle designed to def@@ use the w@@ ounded during the end of the Second World War .
it is a little od@@ d to describe a me@@ ha@@ an@@ ist mu@@ r as a way forward .
it is hard to imagine a more attractive vehicle .
a wh@@ eel@@ chair platform , a char@@ ade and a ro@@ l : everything , a luxury .
it would have been far too hard for super@@ flu@@ ous construc@@ tions from the engine@@ er &apos;s des@@ k on the order of business to have put their production on too high and squ@@ ee@@ ze .
however , in a war , what counts is much more per@@ man@@ ability than comfor@@ t .
in this category , there was no fight against elsewhere in the Vietnam j@@ ung@@ le that was tested .
the machine weigh@@ ing less than five hundred kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s in V@@ ae@@ va@@ ta sa@@ cked the head@@ lines where the brak@@ es from W@@ ill@@ y@@ se Y@@ e@@ p , who had been with his super@@ pass capacity , had to be shown in the strongest terms .
for the most part , vehicles with almost 500 kil@@ os of chic@@ ken were used for transport purposes , both as po@@ pp@@ y and as a driving force .
sometimes , ligh@@ ter , un@@ set@@ tling tan@@ ker weapons were f@@ itted with the rest .
however , such a lor@@ ry came down , and this has happened , in the last few years , it was possible for the driver to put the Roma system forward and get it so low that the vehicle could be managed in the bot@@ tles .
the stock was built up until 19@@ 70 , ready up to 11 2@@ 40 , and they were using the army until 19@@ 80 , with the spread of the H@@ M@@ W race .
the next two decades had a rather marg@@ inal significance in the military cir@@ cles of the A@@ T@@ V@@ s .
they came back to the picture after the tw@@ in to@@ w@@ ers fell in New York , and US soldiers found themselves in the deser@@ t of Iraq and Afghanistan .
it is there that the knowledge and the notion that something is needed that would fill the gap between H@@ um@@ we@@ e and the na@@ vy was born .
since the A@@ T@@ V@@ s do not generally provide considerable protection , they are not the best way to deal directly with the challenges of the battle .
however , fast and easy appliances are suitable for carrying out specific tasks .
for example , even in intelligence and rescue operations .
there are currently thousands of A@@ T@@ s and U@@ T@@ V@@ s in the American military .
most of them , such as X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50 , called by the Defence Union , are basically similar to those in the civil operation , but have been supplemented according to the needs of the army .
the names of K@@ aw@@ as@@ i Mugabe , H@@ on@@ d@@ ly ran@@ c@@ he@@ r and Fo@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ al@@ g@@ ly R@@ hin@@ o and Ar@@ ce@@ c C@@ at have been represented , and the ever-increasing choice of the leading military A@@ T@@ de manufacturer Pol@@ ar@@ ise models .
in 2013 , the Pol@@ ar@@ is concluded a five-year agreement with the Centre for American Special For@@ ces ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) on the supply of tw@@ is@@ me@@ tic M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ Z@@ 4 , and a separate five-year agreement on M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50@@ de made in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man , which both inf@@ lam@@ de and inf@@ ant and innova@@ tion@@ -@@ white bees will ensure innovation and innovation . we can also have after the tab@@ oo of 50 c@@ ali@@ b@@ re .
before the M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 market came into the Pol@@ ar , M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 had to be supplied to the military .
in the case of M@@ V@@ 700 , it is a military version of the 7@@ 00@@ c T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man in the Pol@@ ar T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man , which has been included and wanted , a two-@@ part fuel tan@@ k for major distan@@ ces , a strengthened ra@@ am and a few more military equipment with which farmers , or any other forestry , will not have a greater presence .
just as with the Pol@@ ar@@ ise A@@ T@@ s , John De@@ ere M@@ -@@ G@@ e@@ ta@@ ts , used successfully in Iraq and in Afghanistan , they are equipped with armed forces , b@@ agg@@ res@@ sor and some other elements that are useful in be@@ at@@ o@@ es but necessary in the combat zone .
a vehicle weigh@@ ing 750 k@@ g will be able to take on almost its body weight , in other words , 5@@ 70 kil@@ o degrees .
the capacity of the engine will also be sufficient to transport ligh@@ ter off@@ s and me@@ gal@@ in@@ ers .
the amended image of a guarantee that exclu@@ des the aspects of which it makes it possible to vehicle b@@ agg@@ age from A point B , which is a small but pu@@ ppe@@ t large of the pu@@ mp .
later , the revised versions A@@ 1 , which are 20 ho@@ bu@@ g power more powerful than the original 20-@@ 20-@@ ho@@ bu@@ robust M@@ -@@ G@@ ator , and the subsequent strengthened A@@ 2 framework , which is even better to manage and pu@@ mp difficulties , and A@@ 3 , which has combined the positive characteristics of A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 .
the fire bri@@ ga@@ des , Mes@@ s@@ rs , in fact , as early as 1997 and 1998 , in Bosnia , where medical bri@@ ga@@ des used them to eva@@ cu@@ ate the vulnerable .
at the same time , they also reduced the burden on their own mobile soldiers by ste@@ al@@ ing a degree that would otherwise have had to be paid to the market .
if the majority of the A@@ T@@ s in the power structures are specifications for vehicles used in civil consumption , there are also some exceptions .
the most prominent are the names of P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International Pro@@ w@@ ler in military relations , which have been used successfully throughout the world in all even@@ tu@@ alities , intelligence and rescue missions .
according to the manufacturer , for the first time ten years , the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks of vehicles that have been presented and set up to carry out special operations have been overcome , which are typical of the traditional AT@@ s and also of those that the army needs to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , both in terms of man@@ if@@ est , re@@ sili@@ ence and safety .
as someone who is from construction and from the greatest distance to normal A@@ T@@ V@@ le , Pro@@ w@@ ler is completely different in terms of both its design and capacity .
it is quicker , more res@@ istan@@ t , more stable and able both to manage and experience greater difficulties than other vehicles of the same kind .
for example , if , in the case of the ordinary A@@ TV , the driver has to play a constant role in order to maintain a vehicle balance with his body replacement and use both hands to manoeuvre , to speed and to put a brak@@ e , the management of Pro@@ w@@ ler is more similar to the management of the car .
however , it does not matter , in the end , whether the Pro@@ w@@ ler , the G@@ ator , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or another A@@ T@@ V or the U@@ TV - the concept and area of use are similar to all of them .
and it is clear that in circumstances where defence spending is being over@@ stret@@ ched and the sc@@ at@@ tered , fixed targets instead of the wider conventional war are being har@@ as@@ sed , ligh@@ t-@@ weight and fast ligh@@ t-@@ duty ligh@@ t-@@ duty ligh@@ t-@@ we@@ aring vehicles are with the army that has joined the army to stay in service .
&apos;@@ L@@ oo@@ k late , but I was not &apos; , the actor Ra@@ iv@@ o E@@ . at the dam in I@@ ron@@ man 7@@ 0.@@ 3 fin@@ i@@ Å¡@@ is a wide s@@ lau@@ gh .
it is true that , in the course of the entire half-@@ long trialogue , the na@@ vel@@ t R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t did not get away .
what is more , with 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres running , he got a conver@@ sation charge : &apos; I spoke to one person during a drin@@ k , one man wal@@ ked down and won@@ dered : &apos; I@@ ss@@ and you are still talking about the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ! &apos;
at the distance of J@@ oo@@ ta Ra@@ iv@@ o , who had energy for che@@ ese , went over a few spe@@ eds to a fast wal@@ k .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er &apos;s recommendation .
&apos;@@ A@@ in-@@ AL@@ A@@ R Ju@@ h@@ ans@@ on said that the moun@@ tains can wal@@ k up , that there is no point in forcing up , because there are such increases here and there is little difference in time as to whether a drin@@ k or a motor@@ way wal@@ k , &apos; says the speaker , &apos; says that he took the lead and advi@@ ser to hear the words of the Ad@@ vi@@ ser .
at the same time , he was able to b@@ reat@@ h the times of his wal@@ k and , even after the fin@@ ishing line , he was able to exchange un@@ brea@@ th@@ ed on the left and the right inter@@ view .
as if there were no floods of 1.@@ 9 kilometres behind us , 90 kilometres of cy@@ c@@ ling and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres of drin@@ k .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I think my training is also such that I can enjoy this competition &apos; , admit to a train in January , and today my body scale has been lost by 16 k@@ g in the fa@@ it ac@@ compli@@ s .
and , as far as inter@@ views are concerned , it was my wish that I could have done after the fin@@ ishing inter@@ views .
after every con@@ test , I have been able to give inter@@ views and I had hoped that it would be good to have been able to do so even after O@@ te@@ n@@ Ã¤ I@@ ron@@ man .
I thought it would then be all well if , after I@@ ron@@ man , I was not on the west coast &apos; : in contrast to the pe@@ anu@@ ts of the West Mid@@ lands , the Ra@@ iv@@ o fin@@ i@@ ch@@ i@@ line offered a completely different picture : a hand in a vic@@ in@@ ity towards win@@ ning the sky and a genuine jo@@ y of victory .
there was also reason : R@@ ai@@ vo@@ l took 46 minutes and 24 seconds , 90 kilometres of vehicle for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres to run 2 hours and 18 minutes .
&apos;@@ my heart has now been given to the trialogue &apos; confirms Ra@@ iv@@ o , who has already sh@@ ou@@ ted in the fin@@ i@@ tu@@ m that he gave a finger of friendship to sport , and it took a finger at the tax@@ i .

the third f@@ esti@@ val day of the We@@ ek will send a strong wind .
that is how the A@@ da@@ p@@ per in the eye of the wh@@ is@@ tle@@ b@@ low@@ s was left in the hands of the cap@@ tain who is trying to fly by the wind in the thro@@ es .
without this right , many f@@ esti@@ vals even state that ski@@ es and eyes are full in the s@@ and .
I think we have done quite well .
we have done our job and doing well &apos; , the out@@ going police officer , And@@ res S@@ human , says how the Weber has broken for them for the first two night .
S@@ human er says that , even today , pat@@ ro@@ l poli@@ ce@@ men and rapid respon@@ dents are on the streets and are also in contact with people - that is , they have questions and they also want to know how to get a rapid response .
in two days , the police have had to deal with some of the bra@@ ins and also with drug cases .
&apos;@@ There have been some nar@@ co@@ tic handling of a large quantity of nar@@ co@@ tic substances as well , but summar@@ ies when the We@@ e@@ p is over &apos; says S@@ human .
a few hundred people have been through the police station for two n@@ ights .
fortunately , extreme strikes against the police have not been necessary .
incidentally , S@@ human er says that when the ski@@ es come from ste@@ e@@ ply and horiz@@ on@@ tally , they do not have a lot of work .
one of the leaders in the field of the police in Haiti has ever said that the rain is like the extra worker .
the rest of the police have also done sta@@ r in the We@@ e@@ p area , where things that have been found can be done and where their missing affairs can be coun@@ ted as well .
by the way , the police even lost out as one of their necessary vi@@ ves , which was delivered by good people .
look at the video that Mr S@@ humanity &apos;s A@@ ppe@@ t was still talking about .
however , the Weber Bal@@ tic@@ os@@ s b@@ os@@ s G@@ un@@ na@@ r Vi@@ es talks to the R@@ ight that , at the beginning of years ago , the F@@ esti@@ val received Finland and its owners went to look under the coast side of Ri@@ ia to enlargement , suspended P@@ Ã¤@@ n@@ us and so oli@@ f@@ esti@@ val sold in Estonia .
G@@ un@@ na@@ r says that they have committed 25 000 visitors a day , but the buses will only be coun@@ ted when the f@@ esti@@ val passes .
the preparation for this year has already started in September .
&apos;@@ We had the city &apos;s information that construction begins at last site , there will be a ho@@ tel &apos; , says G@@ un@@ na@@ r what change the Quartet had to face this year .
there is not a single K@@ op@@ pa there at the moment , but one would think that if the K@@ O@@ P@@ P did not go into May this year , the next will be .
perhaps that is how we should have moved somewhere away from it &apos; , he explains why the f@@ esti@@ val has moved this year .
the capital order will be over these years .
people work in We@@ e@@ p between a thousand and a half thousand - police officers , management teams , volunte@@ ers , traders , security and so on .
the hardest thing , according to the We@@ ek , was to get a du@@ o T@@ him Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers .
after all , men are now the un@@ disputed figure of the po@@ p@@ music world .
why T@@ he Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ens was difficult to get a Weber , and how does G@@ un@@ na@@ r comment that two perfor@@ mers cancelled their representa@@ tions , are already looking at video ?
the West is coming from th@@ era@@ pi@@ es to Estonia .
in the north of Estonia , there have already been a number of noise stories and a few spar@@ ks to be seen .
this afternoon , the digital service also issued a discre@@ et warning .
today , mainly in North Estonia , there are a number of sudden .
sudden bills are moving from the West to the east quickly .
&apos;@@ F@@ or wind out@@ breaks in the home country up to 15 , island and coastal 18 m / s , but the sudden may result in stronger wind@@ s &apos; , stands on the service website .
however , a much larger heat storm ra@@ ges from south-@@ east Finland and Russia to the east of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg .
fortunately , in Estonia , the wind@@ s are b@@ low@@ ing from the West and from the E@@ ath , so there is no risk at least initially that the major stor@@ ms would turn to Estonia .
the F@@ in@@ ns organised a dance dance for their men .
when the first male tan@@ kers in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ res were held 11 years ago , the organ@@ ise@@ rs probably did not forget that the northern neighbours from the small town of Estonia would follow suit .
today , however , the first Finnish tan@@ kers are being held in the west of Finland in La@@ pu@@ a .
&apos;@@ The representatives of the city of La@@ pu@@ a were so enthusias@@ tic about the male tan@@ ker in the last friendship city in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ res that they wanted to organise something similar &apos; , reported R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e ab@@ il@@ na@@ t@@ Ã© K@@ ai@@ h@@ la@@ k .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is what is happening today in Finland with the La@@ pu@@ a p@@ per la@@ yer , in Finnish 100 celebra@@ tions , at Mi@@ es@@ -@@ T@@ ans@@ si@@ pi@@ do@@ t , where there are also 100 men from V@@ ir@@ u@@ land &apos; , in the words of Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
according to Pi@@ h@@ la@@ dy , this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two cities of friendship .
it also marks the anniversary of the Est@@ onian and Finnish re@@ public@@ s .
among the 100 dance men , the chief winner of 69 times , Kar@@ l Re@@ in@@ k@@ u@@ b@@ as , is also a ro@@ cket .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me have the honour of being one of the 100 men who , with their atten@@ dance in Finland , are the men of V@@ ir@@ u capable of &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e tan@@ g@@ led men have set everything in their mad working order to show a decent level for northern neighbours &apos; , also commen@@ ted on the undertaking A@@ ga@@ in@@ val member of the R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e municipal government .

the first Est@@ onian male tan@@ ker was organised in 2006 , the last in 2015 in R@@ ak@@ ve@@ res .
although media attention has been focused mainly on the P@@ Ã¤@@ r@@ t and on the We@@ ek that is taking place there , it is not the only music affair this weekend .
there are also loy@@ alty f@@ esti@@ vals on the In@@ ci@@ rid Fron@@ t .
one of them wri@@ tes , for example , in T@@ wit@@ ter : &apos; I sold the Weber ticket so that I can go to In@@ ci@@ rest &apos; .
and why not .
in addition to domestic artists , there will also be perfor@@ mers from America , Finland , Lithuania , Hungary , England and elsewhere .
the f@@ esti@@ val in the global forest also sur@@ prises the ar@@ ts there due to the location of the ma@@ gic w@@ and .
one of them , Lu@@ c@@ y Ro@@ se , was unable to wonder today in T@@ wit@@ ter , where Estonia has a beautiful place .
however , visitors have also not been narrow in the distribution of intermediate walls .
in order to be able to participate in the earthquake itself , the g@@ alle@@ ts are also looking at !
although you have reached a weekend , you have not lost the course of action .
there is still a lot of hard work , trying to s@@ pu@@ r other people on too .
one could forget the concerns and , together with the cost of we@@ aring out .
take the time for you to enjoy each other in a beautiful , ro@@ man@@ tic place .
when we talk about the bus@@ h , there are big plans , or promises ... which , a moment later , seem to be going .
the second party , however , rec@@ alls your words .
being a fri@@ gate is in some way une@@ con@@ om@@ ical , it is difficult to focus on something .
your sense of self-@@ estee@@ m may not depend on what is happening now , but on the things that have happened in the past .
in a difficult situation , too , it would be possible to act quickly and in a rational manner .
you may help someone out of trouble today because you have enough intelligence and determination .
rather , there is a lack of concern about money and business matters .
take the time to bur@@ y and rela@@ x .
working on the P@@ RC can be ti@@ res@@ ome and can be a cause of ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .
it may be that , with experience , there is a serious dispute in which you have to defend your positions for@@ cefully .
if others cross the border , you will do that .
you feel better in a habi@@ tual environment , doing things that you can and that can be jo@@ y .
you will probably not be thir@@ st@@ y for new knowledge and ad@@ venture now .
eva@@ ding is an activity that you will probably never get full of appe@@ tite .
today , too , you are on your back .
however , what happens in a family is not necessarily normal .
it may be that , in spite of a free day , you still have to conten@@ d with a glass of th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic v@@ ans .
or then they will be physi@@ cally at home , but they will still be at the table .
if you want to experience hard , you can offer it to travel .
in the course of the ad@@ venture , you are taking on board , you have to pull together to keep on the wave and to maintain a balance .
wasted energy arguing for money .
only if the situation really requires urgent and decisive intervention will it take up .

however , these claims were fla@@ gran@@ tly be@@ tra@@ yed by the police .
the scre@@ ens of the fields stated that they would not make a statement on what happened .
according to the D@@ PA of the German Sci@@ enti@@ fic Agency , this step is due to the lack of trust in the police or judicial bodies in particular .

the pat@@ ch@@ work of Est@@ onian children is influenced by multi@@ f@@ res@@ ses .

the S@@ h@@ op@@ ers of Estonia probably did not have much among them , because the la@@ ck@@ lus@@ h of the K@@ ing children allegedly leave our parents completely cold .

the police confirmed the suspect Polish citizen , Lu@@ kas@@ z Her@@ ba , who lives in Britain .
according to the newspaper Cor@@ ri@@ ere del@@ la Ser@@ a , the man found that the kidna@@ pped woman had a small child and did not want to sell her as sex sla@@ ves .
the delicate data on vulnerable children of neg@@ ligence was published as a result of the prof@@ ite@@ ering of a depart@@ ment .
as a result of the worrying infringement of information , the personal data of children who are wrong@@ ly care@@ tak@@ er , including information on whether they are sexu@@ ally active , were sent to the mother of a child .
a mother was sent with e-@@ mail , which included the names of all children in the city of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia , the bir@@ th@@ day , the places of birth , and the specific concerns and places where they are concerned .
the ema@@ il revealed every child &apos;s place of residence .
it has been pointed out in the list that a 13@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y has been released against a ba@@ il and that sexual behaviour shows that one young gir@@ l from 15 years with problems of self-@@ inju@@ ry , abuse and disposal of certain substances is &apos; outside a bo@@ y friend &apos; and &apos; no laugh@@ ter this evening , and that one of the 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y needs help in &apos; and that it is physi@@ cally safe and bloody &apos; .
the table seems to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the super@@ vis@@ or of night exchange .
the document contains notes as to when some children are waiting home or whether they can make contact with staff in order to be able to stay in .
there are alar@@ ming@@ ly many details on some children .
there is a warning about a 15@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y : &apos; when staff contact to get permission to search and / or lap@@ top do@@ g / U@@ S@@ B to be reviewed because of an inappropriate sexual material , this authorisation must be granted &apos; .
the document also states that a 17@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l , who will only be in three months &apos; time and will be exemp@@ ted from welfare institutions , is at risk of a suicide bom@@ ber to such an extent that staff will have to call an emergency labor@@ atory immediately when he es@@ ca@@ pes .
it was noted that he was out of the EU-@@ 16 suspended bo@@ y and &apos; later conta@@ cted with staff to go after &apos; .
although only the name of a house in which children are kept and not their addresses has been mentioned in the places listed , there are still plenty of detail enough to be able to find them .
the data leakage from 2015 came out when the mother , F@@ air@@ fa@@ x ME@@ D@@ IA , had her experience with the Ministry of Health and services and with child protection since she took up her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter four years ago .
he agreed to share his concerns now that his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had received 18 and left systems .
the hear@@ t-@@ breaking decision to hand over their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter to the protection of children was taken after a violent incident at home , a case which is one of the ever more cases of family violence experienced by parents against their children .
it had worrying consequences that the mother could never have predicted ; for example , he was able to get seven criminal charges within six months of leaving his home , he was moving to hundreds of kilometres of home and swe@@ at@@ ings where he had successfully handled , but then he was moved back without informing the parents , and he was able to facilitate and care for the relationship between his parents and his two da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters .
the relationship with the former friends of the bo@@ y , the 17@@ -year period with which the welfare institutions allowed a woman to attend a local ho@@ tel regularly at the time of 15 years , ended when a young person was presented a few days after the age of 18 because of his relationship with a child &apos;s offence .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y did he get out of the system worse than when he enters there ? &apos; calls the mother ?
&apos;@@ and will this happen to all the children of neg@@ ligence ? &apos;
he speaks volumes in favour of creating an authority to enable children to be tra@@ ced in the health and service minis@@ try in the first few weeks after they are taken into care before they are moved to their homes .
this would enable them to understand better how children intera@@ ct with others and what the risks and their needs are , particularly in an educational way .
the government of the state is looking for new ways of reducing the need for children to be placed in their homes , in an attempt , among other things , to support their parents better .
a definite guide@@ line of aid packages , financed by EUR 62 million over four years , is aimed at helping children to move from home to better organisation of care .
furthermore , USD 5.@@ 6 million of a two-@@ year experim@@ ent made public by last October will enable professional carers to be offered to at least 28 children in order to help them get out of their welfare or avoid getting into it .
according to a representative of the depart@@ ment , information leakage was not officially noti@@ fied when it happened , although the mother says that two departments were informed within a few months of the incident .
the depart@@ ment is now working with the service provider to analyse the case .
&apos;@@ A@@ ll alleged privacy records will be taken very seriously and we will work to ensure that it has not had a negative impact on the young people concerned &apos; .
last July , the Minister for Fam@@ ily and the Chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood , J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ ik@@ kos , commission@@ ed an independent review of the privacy of children &apos;s sam@@ ples during a five-year period .
the depart@@ ment agreed to the seven recommendations as a result of this and has subsequently updated the EC@@ HR to ensure that staff clearly understand their roles and privacy procedures , changed IT systems to ban the automatic transfer of certain personal data , and formally looked at the privacy services of the depart@@ ment .

Vietnam &apos; regre@@ ts &apos; the kid@@ na@@ pp@@ ings in Germany .
Vietnam said on Thursday that it regre@@ ts the comments made by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs that blame the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese intelligence service for the kidna@@ pping of a former carri@@ er of vi@@ et@@ h who is reco@@ vered at home because of the charges of sta@@ teh@@ ood .
the German authorities believe that T@@ rin@@ h X@@ u@@ an T@@ han@@ h was seized by Berlin , which left the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese po@@ et@@ ric on Wednesday 48 hours to leave the country .
T@@ han@@ h faces han@@ h charges involving the death penalty in the event of conviction .
he sought as@@ y@@ l from Germany , but his statement had not yet been worked through when the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese authorities called for his extradition .
the representative of the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le T@@ hi Th@@ u Han@@ g , told the re@@ por@@ ters that these comments are &apos; extremely regrettable &apos; and T@@ han@@ h gave himself to the police in Vietnam on 31 July .
&apos;@@ Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m always attaches importance and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany &apos; , he said without going into detail .
T@@ han@@ h , 51 , last July , after the initial dis@@ honest charge of state oil and gas in the dispute between Pet@@ ro@@ sian Vietnam , resulted in losses of approximately USD 150 million .
the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese police issued an arrest warrant in September .
in March , the police launched an investigation to investigate appropri@@ ation in connection with its alleged participation in the property project .
T@@ han@@ h was the chairman of B@@ et@@ na@@ m Con@@ st@@ ru@@ ti@@ on Jo@@ t Sto@@ ck Cor@@ por@@ ation until 2013 , when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government , including the Vice-@@ Chair of the Gi@@ ang province in the southern Me@@ ta@@ g Del@@ ta .
he was elected in May 201@@ 6 to the National Assembly , but was rele@@ gated to an overwhelming legislative body of Commun@@ ists before the first month following that session .
he was also ex@@ pelled from the Communist Party .
the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese A@@ mb@@ assador in Germany was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday and reported to him that Germany would call for the return of T@@ han@@ h so that asylum and extradition procedures could be properly implemented .
the results of the investigation show that prin@@ ted se@@ eds are also spread by prin@@ ter .
like bir@@ ds and m@@ am@@ m@@ als , prin@@ ted pr@@ ans are also spreading .
these in@@ sec@@ ts are mainly known as la@@ go@@ s helping to disman@@ tle bot@@ tom@@ -up substances under the forest .
however , it is also the se@@ eds that help the populations to distribute them .
Japanese scientists found that prin@@ ted car@@ ro@@ ts have an important role to play in the distribution of se@@ eds by the mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ tru@@ m mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ tru@@ m forest species .
this is an unusual plant .
it does not contain k@@ lo@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã¼@@ l , which is why it is not capable of photo@@ syn@@ the@@ sis .
instead , the species becomes one of its nutri@@ ent pig@@ s under the ground .
the T@@ ai@@ m po@@ les small flav@@ our@@ ings on the forest basis and the smallest white fruit .
Vil@@ os have very few tas@@ tes or no heat , and Japanese researchers found that poultry and m@@ am@@ m@@ am@@ m@@ als are not interested in them as a food source .
only a hand@@ ful of sp@@ ine@@ less consumption of arable and forest car@@ ro@@ t B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p@@ ica was the only species that regularly visited fru@@ its .
investi@@ g@@ ators checked prin@@ ter emissions to determine whether these in@@ sec@@ ts help the se@@ eds to dissemin@@ ate them .
scientists found that a fe@@ e@@ ble de@@ par@@ ted after feeding every grain contained an average of three so@@ ils .
further tests have confirmed that the vast majority of the se@@ ed that has been raised was viable .
scientists assume that this unique plant state has probably learned to make use of the ability to dissemin@@ ate prin@@ ted se@@ eds in the course of evolution .
we have the w@@ ives han@@ ging near the ground and they are ready while the pr@@ inc@@ es go out of their di@@ sen@@ chan@@ ted sta@@ di@@ um .
the investi@@ g@@ ators published their findings this week in the B@@ ot@@ an@@ ic@@ al J@@ our@@ nal of the L@@ in@@ ne@@ an Soci@@ ety .
&apos;@@ whereas , to date , approximately 4 600 pr@@ us@@ sa@@ c@@ ali@@ k has been identified , the distribution of se@@ eds through prin@@ ted car@@ us@@ sa@@ tions can be much wider and still is not just an un@@ documented mechanism , not just the unique ability of a fixed plant to take advantage of prin@@ ted car@@ ro@@ ts &apos; , in the press release Na@@ o@@ to Su@@ gi@@ a , a co-@@ prof@@ es@@ sor of the University of K@@ am@@ um@@ um@@ o@@ to .
&apos;@@ It is hoped that the dis@@ closed brea@@ d will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and pr@@ ans and to look for further examples of how prin@@ ted se@@ eds can be dissemin@@ ated &apos; .
the F@@ ly@@ so-called report on the disclosure of improved information , which shows additional payments .
Michael F@@ l@@ y@@ o , who served for a short time as President tru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s national security advi@@ ser , presented on Thursday a report on the disclosure of improved federal financial information containing new details of the F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n contracts in connection with the transfer of the tru@@ mp@@ hon@@ y to the post of President , the I@@ ra@@ u@@ -@@ American business man company and the bo@@ y campaign for a research company .
the letter , which sent information with re@@ pa@@ irs , stated by Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ o that his initial reports on disclosure of information were submitted under accelerated conditions without the usual consultation and review provided by the White House and Government E@@ th@@ ics Office .
according to the letter , F@@ ly@@ p@@ us did not receive the attention given to others , as he was no longer an employee of the White House at the time .
F@@ ly@@ ph@@ or@@ us re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ished his office just 24 days after taking office , amid the rum@@ ours that he had given misleading information to Vice-President P@@ en@@ ce on his post-@@ election links with the Russian A@@ mb@@ assador to the United States .
he has also received criticism on account of the external payments made to him during his work in the private sector following the re@@ signa@@ tion of the Director of the Defence Agency in 2014 .
in the information previously published to investi@@ g@@ ators from the House of De@@ pu@@ ties , F@@ ly@@ so-called declared that around USD 68 000 were paid and paid from Russian units in 2015 .
in addition to the income in relation to Russia , the information provided on Thursday revealed that F@@ ly@@ so-called has received at least 5 000 dollars for consul@@ tan@@ cy services for the nuclear power plant construction project in the Middle East .
F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s work on the project was published earlier , but it was not known that he was paid for it .
the renewed information also confirms that F@@ l@@ y@@ p@@ o had agreed to cooperate with S@@ C@@ L G@@ ro@@ u@@ f - C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge An@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ a &apos;s British parent company at that time - that is , the F@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp@@ i campaign .
one of the main contribu@@ tors to C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge is the mag@@ na@@ te of hedge funds , Robert L@@ . mer@@ c@@ e@@ r , whose da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Re@@ be@@ ka@@ h is an influential Conservative financial supporter .
Washington Po@@ st announced in February that the F@@ ly@@ h@@ t S@@ C@@ L G@@ ro@@ u@@ p would be a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or .
according to those who know his role , F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s aim was to help the S@@ C@@ L@@ -@@ -@@ American subsidi@@ aries win new public contracts with the United States .
at the same time , the S@@ C@@ L is the driving force behind the office of one of the F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s Govern@@ or of the National In@@ tel@@ ligence Office .
the &apos; F@@ ly@@ &apos; person who is familiar with his activities received no compensation and no real work .
with the new information , it came public that the F@@ l@@ y@@ o Gu@@ ard received about 28 000 dollars in connection with the presidential transfer .
the largest dis@@ closed source of income is USD 140 000 for F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s work in Minsk as advi@@ ser and consul@@ tant to N@@ J@@ K Hol@@ ding C@@ or@@ p@@ us , a company led by Mr Kaz@@ em@@ in@@ y , a business@@ man born in Iran and who is currently living in the United States .
the As@@ soli@@ ci@@ des press reported on Thursday evening of the statement of the N@@ J@@ K , according to which &apos; instru@@ cted the F@@ ly@@ N@@ J@@ K Hol@@ ding on the interest of investing in the securities of companies &apos; .
N@@ J@@ K finances a technology company G@@ re@@ en@@ Z@@ one Sy@@ ste@@ m@@ s , of which F@@ l@@ y@@ o vi@@ ce-@@ chairman is .
the G@@ re@@ en@@ Z@@ one con@@ qu@@ er is run by B@@ ij@@ an K@@ i@@ an , F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s business partner , F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ Ã¡n In@@ te@@ lis , a company that is currently under investigation because of its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands , which is involved in the government of Turkey .
earlier on Thursday , E@@ li@@ yes in C@@ um@@ m@@ om@@ s ( M@@ d ) , the leader in the Committee on the Monitoring of the House of Represen@@ ta@@ tives and the reform of the government , asked K@@ i@@ an@@ i to provide information on foreign commercial contacts and tri@@ ps .
during his earlier security check , K@@ i@@ an military investi@@ g@@ ators said that he had several foreign commercial contact with his partner .
according to C@@ U@@ M@@ I@@ N@@ G@@ S , F@@ l@@ y@@ o so-called investi@@ g@@ ators said nothing about such contacts .
according to the claims of a person familiar with the situation , the F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called &apos; no &apos; was subject to security checks at that time .
