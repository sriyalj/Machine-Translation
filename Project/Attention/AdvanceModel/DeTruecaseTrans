Is there finally a solution to avoid tedious roby speeches ?
For Mr Rizzo , answering the phone is often a waste of time .
His Sport City Pizza Pub , based in Buffalos in New York , is dependent on clients ring up and outsourcing cancers , pizza and potatoes .
But , for a large part of the time , these are automatic messages that try to get fraud through .
&apos;When it is coming to the point that it does not allow the other strategists to get us in &apos; , a 24-year-old bar owner said .
Aid is on the way , albeit slowly .
Over the past year , at government inspired by the mobile phones , new tools have been added to counteract unwanted &apos; robotted &apos; calls .
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed enabling telephone companies to block junk calls more and hopes to defuse petitioners with high fines .
According to the experts , these steps are not a final solution , but they are a good start .
Federalist and shareholders should protect people from unwanted calls from distance distributors .
However , the fraudsters are not interested in breaking the law .
Fraudsters reach people cheaply and easily using &apos; automatic voters &apos; , which automatically make more speeches at the same time .
It is estimated that the Americans receive tens of millions of Romans a day .
All of them , of course , are not fraudulent .
Pharmacies send out , for example , automated messages about compliance with prescriptions .
However , all too often the situation is as follows : Be in debt to the tax authorities ; Microsoft calls to order a computer for free crusades !
In addition , junk brokers use complex technology , which shows a local or important number on their telephony , such as the tax office .
Implementing appropriate measures for &apos; swindle numbers &apos; would aggravate fraud and help US consumers to save millions of dollars , as stated in the document by the Public Prosecutor Group of State Interests .
Telephone companies and independent applications are able to drive or block unwanted speeches in comparison to known problem numbers and analyse dubious behaviour , such as the number , which calls for many people in non-call lists .
Management free service providers also have a tool to add warnings to incoming speeches such as &apos; possibly fraudulent &apos; , but they are not available on all telephony and on many customers with paid cards .
They can be ordered by Verizon and Sprinter for a super levy .
Some Android-telephones , including Google i Pixel , travel junk calls free of charge .
Jen Vargas ( 39 ) media producer from Organos Florda said that his AT application would mark and block certain fraudulent speeches on his mobile phone , but he has given up his mobile phone .
&apos;very rarely do I take speeches from figures that I do not know &apos; said in Wargas .
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer free , but limited , relief for domestic phones .
In the case of YouMail , the operator must allow &apos; conditional conversion &apos; , which will drive the speeches forward if the line is not answered or occupied .
Nomorobo is not available for all service providers in the home and does not work with parents , colum-based telephones .
It is also possible to buy references , some of which are quite abundantly sophisticated , which block calls on domestic phones .
Verizon is also test of dubious calls for warnings to be displayed on domestic phones .
Telephone companies can already block certain speeches that are fraudulent .
The Flec has proposed rules to formalise such practices and allow other speeches suspected of fraud to be blocked .
This means that Verizon can block a duty-free number that accommodate calls for payment but never starts a single figure on its own .
Operators would also be able to block speeches where they know that they are not legitimate , for example , with 911 guideline numbers .
These rules need further elaboration .
Maureen Mahoney , a public policing officer in a non-profit-making consumer union , said that these developments were &apos; encouraging &apos; but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls .
Firstly , non-EU lists do not apply to certain types of phone chargers , such as creditors and political campaigns .
In addition , according to Mahoney , only falsified figures would be covered .
Not all the rockets are intended to be swindled .
The consumer union wants telephone companies to make available to all consumers free of charge , in order to block calls .
In the long term , the Flec industry supports attempts to affirm that it is indeed the caller who claims to be the one he claims to be .
Perhaps one day it will be possible to see a green light on the screen on the screen if the caller is legitimate .
The lobby of the telecom companies , U.S. Telecom , says that it could take several years to introduce it , but that would be a powerful tool against roboilers .
Fcc is also looking at ways to end the succession of tedious speeches to consumers who change the number .
If you register at the moment on the &apos; no-call &apos; list , but obtain a new number for yourself later on , you may not know it and may not bother on the new line .
&apos;Robothelers are not going to disappear &apos; , Aaron Foss Nomorobost , a service for blocking calls for mobile phones and domestic phones .
&apos;They are criminal and find a new way of bypassing any system .
However , it is our job to make it as difficult as possible for them &apos; .
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should implement .
Do not answer the phone if you do not know the numbers .
Yes , this is unfortunately not practical for business calls like Sport City .
Cut off the unwanted speeches .
Do not speak up and press no button .
When you engage with them , they can mention you with a gentleman who will react and bury you with more speeches .
If possible , block the number after the speech .
Use the applications to block speeches .
If you have concerns about privacy , check the application rules to see whether it shares your account or contact data with distributors .
Do not put personal data on the phone chargers , such as a bank account or a social security number .
The Nordea and DNB combined bank will become a reality by the end of the year .
The accession of the financial groupings bearing the name of DNB and Nordea , Luminori , will only happen in the last quarter of this year , will be written by Tuesday .
The opening of the common legal body has been delayed and delayed .
Following the publication of the accession plans in the summer , the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter .
In April , however , the DNB communication manager said that it was delayed in the third quarter .
Indeed , the Swedish financial inspectorate , Luminor , given the regional importance of the International Bank , gave additional guidance to fulfil .
Russia &apos;s railways are looking into the possibility of getting the St buri-Kaliningradi-Berlin travelling train off the road .
Russia &apos;s railways are studying the possibility of getting the Berlin-Petersburg train via Kaliningrad , who was reported to Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad , the Director-General of the Kaliningrad railway .
The monitor for travel travel is about the fact that , from an economic point of view , it is hardly possible to put the Kaliningrad - Berlin trains on the table again .
And we are offering a second route - Berliin-Kaliningrad-Petersburg .
The technical means to do this exist , both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of rolling stock &apos; , Mr Golomolzin said .
Additionally , Golomolzin stated that there are already Russian trains that can replace the radar and continue to travel on the European track basin .
Golomolzin believes that this is the direction in the long term , because at the moment , the inhabitants of St Petersburg and the entire north-west of Russia are having to travel to Germany via Moscow and Bresti .
As a possible option , Latvia will be discussed along the route through Latvia , the Latvian Delft ( Latvija Dzelzelzella ) was approved by a press spokesman in MÃ¢rir Ozols , who said that there is no specific decision at the moment , but the option is under discussion .
The Latvian railway , together with its partners , including the Russian railways , is looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in passenger flow services so that rail transport can compete with road transport .
The Chinese company , which came to Estonia , immediately ordered EUR 100 million .
The Chinese owner of agricultural produce , Agritera , which only began operations last year , has reached almost EUR 100 million .
A profit of nearly EUR 2 million is written by Tuesday .
According to the company &apos;s annual report , sales revenue from agricultural output combined with wholesale Agritera will reach EUR 100.6 million in 2016 .
The profits were made at EUR 1.91 million .
A year earlier , there was no economic activity at the company .
The company had an average population of 3 people , and in 2015 there were no workers .
The turnover per worker amounted to EUR 33.6 million , with an average gross income of EUR 316 per month .
We already have a four-day working week , but not as we expect .
Open office .Foto : Scanpix , PantherMedia / Wavebreakmea Ltd
Many Estonians already have , without their knowledge , a Thursday working week .
However , not as they are waiting to write Tuesday .
It has been created by modern work space planning , in other words , an open office .
In the office without Seinteta , a prestigious management magazine Harmard Business Review provides workers with almost 1.5 hours a day , that is to say , almost an entire working day a week .
However , if the working week of Thursday is considered as four working days and three rest days , then such a forced solution will be worse than that .
One and a half hours of working time have been concentrated with the family and with difficulty of focusing instead of hobbies or wasteful recovery , disruption of work , rising irritation and anxiety , and a loss of work will .
How do we finance company vehicles ?
There has been a change in the consumer society in terms of financing the vehicles of the enlarged companies - with more and more companies taking full service or , on the contrary , a freer , long-stay car .
The leasing and leasing of a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions , which include multiple obligations and expectations , but which often lead to confusion .
According to the opinion of the international author &apos;s company , the Estonian Production and Market Governor , Villi Taidis , we can see that companies are moving more and more towards full service and that long-term lease opportunities are increasingly being used .
The plant pointed out the main issues to which , when looking for answers , it will be possible to choose the way in which the vehicle is used for itself .
How long can you use the vehicle ?
The biggest difference in car renting and leasing is the time for use .
&apos;Living is worth preferring to longer-term vehicle necessity if a company has plans to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period &apos; , explained by the TV , adding that it is worth deciding in favour of a plant if it is to have a vehicle , to have a full-time service , to have a long-term drive , if it is to use a vehicle as a service or to use a car on a daily basis , but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and to give up ownership .
&apos;The car of Rendicar has a much shorter use period than the literary period , but many major car rental companies also provide a long-term authoritative , with car rental without complex contracts and free refund &apos; , presented different ways of leasing a car .
Who will become the owner of the vehicle ?
At the end of the publication , the owner of the rental car becomes the owner of the car .
&apos;in the case of full service , at the end of the facilitation period , it will be possible to carry on with the lignite payment under the same or better conditions , with a new vehicle equivalent to the needs of the company &apos; , he said , emphasising that , as the consumer society is moving increasingly towards the average consumption of services , owning a vehicle is an additional responsibility for the company .
In addition , when it comes to full service travel , there is also an opportunity to buy a car for itself on the basis of a desire and agreed conditions .
However , there is no lease available and only the use period is paid .
The copying of a car is generally carried out in the offices of car firms , and the rent of a car is leased out from the temporary convoy of the rental companies .
The occupations of car companies , in particular , deal with the sale of vehicles , but also offer the possibility of flying and , in some cases , of the author .
On the other hand , train companies have cars with the sole aim of leasing them out .
The gold said that the reasons for using the rental service are different - many companies are leasing their vehicles , and in addition the service is convenient in being commanded or on holiday , or if one &apos;s own car is improved .
&apos;In the case of commercial vehicles , more and more are switched over to full service travel , providing customers with transparency of costs , time savings in the process of buying , utilising and recouping vehicles , and more comfort &apos; , introduced a growing trend of attraction by the sales and marketing driver .
Every year more and more companies use full services for their fleets , thereby optimising their spending and focusing on their basic business .
What is service based insurance coverage ?
If there is a mandatory cat and motor insurance for a literate car , the rental car is mostly covered by basic insurance and , in addition , it has to be decided whether to include emergency insurance , property insurance or full insurance , for example : &apos; If you compare sales with full service travel , the customer receives an equivalent monthly payment at a higher rate , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , car clothes also cover cover the scheduled monthly payment . Tyre exchanges and other agreed services &apos; , explained by the gold .
&apos;When it is possible to take any new vehicle into a plant , the full service provider helps choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company , which also takes into account the functions of use &apos; , he compared with emphasising that full service coverage would certainly help to optimise the costs incurred by the company in terms of car fleets .
&apos;The selection of lease vehicles , however , depends on the batch of service providers &apos; cars : Different leasing companies offer their vehicle fleet both a small and economical vehicle for urban traffic and a luxury pig for business meetings &apos; .
In the busy lease period , it may , of course , be the case that the desired car is already leased out , but booking in advance will help against it .
The choice between leasing or leasing should first be made clear what its objectives are - how long the desire to use a vehicle will be and what long-term plans are with regard to cars .
It is certainly also worth looking closely at the different conditions and responsibilities of services .
How a single man built a dossier worth paying his daughter 51 million dollars on his daughter .
A living father in Texas discovered that there is no issue in which his disabled daughter could play .
He therefore decided to build one .
Gordon HARTMAN had just come out of the family holiday club when his 12-year-old daughter Mbody approached other children playing in the water .
He tried to screen them , but they quickly left the Basin .
HARTMAN thinks they are horrified because they do not know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive view and also a form of autism .
This incident has left him in haunt .
&apos;Morgan is a young girl in the miracle .
His meeting always leads to a smile of fuss and he certainly wants to tip .
But there have been many times when we have not been able to take him in different places &apos; he says .
HARTMAN and her husband &apos;s Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere he feels comfortable and others would feel comfortable with him as well .
&apos;We come to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place &apos; , HARTMAN will speak .
Therefore , in 2007 he decided to build it himself .
The former property developers sold their home farms in 2005 in order to set up The Gordon HARTMAN Family Foundation - a not-for-profit unit that helps disabled people .
He then started the creation of the &apos; first most accessible item in the world &apos; .
&apos;We wanted to set up a subject area where everyone can do everything where people with special needs and special needs can play &apos; , says HARTMAN .
He called doctors , steel beans , parents and other people with disabilities and disabilities to consult on the facility .
They were erected in San Antonios Texas , a ten-hectares abandoned career .
The park called Morgan &apos; s Wonderland cost USD 34 million ( GBP 26 million ) and opened in 2010 .
The partnerships include a completely accessible view , a random playground and a minirong .
Visitors often say to Hartman that it was not possible for the first time to experience these abuses .
There is also a carousel which has a design translation specially for wheelchairs , which goes up and down the animals .
HARTMAN recognises , however , that the Morgan was initially afraid of driving .
&apos;When we opened , he did not dare to go to it .
He did not understand why it is going round and why the animals are up and down , and HARTMAN says .
It took three years for a Morgan to agree to go to a carousel .
&apos;First of all , he was just standing close to it , then he was going to be creative , but we did not get off the hook .
It was a slow process , but now he likes to drive it .
Overcoming anything that frightened him meant a lot for him .
The small things that have been achieved make a big difference &apos; .
Since its opening , more than a million people have visited 67 countries in Morgan Wonderland and 50 of all American states .
A third of the staff are disabled and entry is free for anyone with a condition .
&apos;I understood that the Morgan is one of the happy ones , because it has many of the things that it needs .
I did not want the price to be an obstacle for other people with special needs &apos; , says HARTMAN .
&apos;Let us do it every year , knowing that we will be left to the detriment of at least a million dollars ( GBP 750 000 ) , and that we will have to reserve it with the help of corps and partners &apos; .
This year , the thematic park Morgan &apos; Inspiration was extended by opening Iceland , that is to say , a fully accessible water park .
&apos;in July , fewer people visited a park because wheelchairs became too heated .
So we decided to set up a water park &apos; , and HARTMAN is talking .
In some parts of the island , warm water has been used , which helps visitors with meat problems .
There are watertight , sedentary wheelchairs available working with pressure and not batteries .
It is also possible to travel boats on the river .
The water park cost a total of USD 17 million ( GBP 13 million ) .
&apos;yesterday a man from Iceland came to me and just kept me away &apos; , HARTMAN is speaking .
&apos;he referred to his son , who has serious special needs , and began to mourn .
He said he had not been able to play his son in the water before &apos; .
According to Hartman , there are no three parks of every four visitors with disabilities , and the batch has exactly the effect that he had hoped .
&apos;This helps people to understand that , although we are different in certain ways , we are actually exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;Let me see how a girl in a wheelchairs went to another girl with no special needs and they began to play together .
It was a real compulsion &apos; .
Hartman does not intend to open any more parks , although he has received hundreds of letters and meles from people who would also like to have their own neighbourhood .
Instead , it will focus in San Antonio on providing educational facilities for adolescents with special needs .
&apos;What I know is that there are many different organisations trying to build something like Mbody &apos; s Wonderland elsewhere , and we will continue to work with them &apos; , adding to it .
It continues to take the Morgani to play a role in this matter - the Morgan is now a kind of glory .
&apos;If he comes here , he is like a rock staar !
Many people want to talk to him and get a picture with him ; he is coping well with it &apos; , and HARTMAN says .
A body that is now 23 years old can do things more and better .
&apos;he is now talking more , and most of his physical problems have been resolved in numerous operations .
We are so proud that he has come that far &apos; .
When a body is visiting the park , it likes to play the most axles and sand , without knowing how much it has helped others .
&apos;Morgan knows that the park has had its name , but I do not believe that he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives &apos; , and HARTMAN says .
&apos;he does not understand that the way he has dealt with things in his life has made him a real source of inspiration &apos; .
The call for drivers to find two girls being raped in Witton is a girl .
The police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the investigation into the rape of a 14-year-old girl .
A teenage attack was on the Birmingham region of Witton on 26 July around 02 : 00 ( BST ) .
Before that attack , he was raped at the Witton station .
In connection with the first case , an accusation has been made against a man .
The British Transport police want to speak as part of an investigation with two drivers .
According to the police , the first car &apos;s herd is a colour coding .
The researcher inspector , Tony Fitzpatrick , said : &apos; We have grounds to believe that the driver of the vehicle at the plant spoke of a victim before the other person picked him and then raped in the car .
We would like to know what was said during this conversation and , in addition , the leader may know the important details that would help us in our investigation &apos; .
The driver of another vehicle , which was described as red VW Sharan , was probably taken home by the police after being raped for a second time .
The cane Genie was named as &apos; Genie &apos; .
The bail-out box , supported by its owner in the course of a reconnaissance treatment , was declared public at a yearly box .
Genie was recognised because he locked up his owner , Evie Henderson ( 11 ) from Lincoln , during six chemical athletes .
Evie was diagnosed with a reconnaissance cancer in March 2016 and the Genie company itself said that it helped to cope with a series of painful operations and a long time spent in hospital .
The cat was recognised by the charity organisation Cats Protection at the ceremony in London .
Photography : According to Evie , cat was in support of him when he lost his long brothers because of chemistry .
&apos;In my view , he is the best .
It deserves that .
He has always been in place for me &apos; ; he said Evie .
&apos;he came to my brother and sat next to my feet .
He then cooked a brick and jumping a softer to sink with his bags on my knees .
When I was too sick to be able to come in or go out , and I had to sit at home , he came to me and made me much happier by offering great comfort &apos; .
According to Evie , he has a special connection with his pet , which was of huge support to him when he lost his hair because of his deafening treatment .
&apos;That led me out very much because I had long brothers and hair .
However , because of the mess , Genie was shouting in the same breath , and because I lost my hair and those of Genie , slightly mitigated the whole shock &apos; .
Evie father , Chris Henderson , said that the box had &apos; a wonderful distraction &apos; and described how Evie &apos; used to look at their beloved pet videsigns in a hospital bed .
&apos;Evie was over 300 days in a hospital , so we spent a lot of time there , and it offered him something to expect when he got home for a few valuable days &apos; .
A 11-year-old saying : &apos; I longed for him every day I was in hospital , and my family said that he was longing for me .
He is my best friend and I really do not know what I would do without him &apos; .
The group is pushing the government to agree on the Brex transitional conditions .
One of the largest groups of business lobbyists in Britain is urging the government to stop dancing around the periphery of Brex .
The Institute of Directors ( IoD ) called on the government to propose the &apos; transitional treaty &apos; in order to make progress with Brexitis smooth .
It wants the government to create a &apos; Brex divide &apos; between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements .
The group warned that without such an agreement there would be &apos; short-term chaotic fisheries volatility &apos; for business activity .
They criticised the government for &apos; engaging in any kind of speculative disputes &apos; .
In recent weeks , members of the government have voiced conflicting views on how long the transition period lasts and what it brings with it .
In the IoD report , &apos; Thankling the Brexs gap - options for a transition &apos; , it says : &apos; Instead of burdening the problem by far , the government must reopen a strategic debate on this issue .
This could minimise the ever-increasing confusion and uncertainty in this area &apos; .
However , this week , Mr Lyons , the economist and the Exconomists for Brex , described concern about the &apos; expensive fluctuating &apos; Brex as the &apos; scaremongering &apos; story &apos; of scaremongering , reminiscent of Y2K &apos;s computer error in fear of the MDGs .
Warakantsler Philip Hammond warned in June : &apos; There is a large amount of business investment that will be delayed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is &apos; .
Allie Renison , IoD EL-trade policy leader , said : &apos; Kantsler has a right to be concerned about the delays in business investment .
This is one of the most frequent changes to be dealt with in connection with Brexitis , alongside the delocalisation of services within the EU .
The latter applies especially to the members of Northern Ireland who are currently considering joint relocation or relocation &apos; .
IoD offers a number of opportunities , including the following extension of Article 50 of the agreement from March 2019 .
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to remain within the government area of EU legislation for a long time .
The creation of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU &apos;s customs union .
Renison said : &apos; IoD proposed these opportunities in connection with the transition , hoping that it will spark a proper debate on how best to bring Brex to a conclusion .
Prioritising the interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic expensive fluctuations do not diminish future opportunities &apos; .
The Australian species are at a crossroads .
Professional sport stands at a crossroads in Australia : Some areas have migrated by corporate means to such an extent that they are too commercially oriented to classify sport ;
Others are returning to the amateur world , which is too sports pretends to regard it as a business .
This confusion is illustrated by the embarrassing delays in reaching a wage agreement with players , by the undecided dismissal of the Australian Rgby Union ( steep ) team , by the stakeholder uprising of the Australian football economy ( ffa ) , by striking striking too hard at putting together an independent commission to function and by Australia &apos;s football league ( AFL ) intransigent attempts to be a beacon social justice and a plague among the people .
The investment banker and the Australian Sport Commission , John Wylie , have attempted to steer the Olympic report on the same path as professional disciplines by placing businessmen in the top positions with no elite experience of sport .
The mining giant Rio Tinto , who has the reputation of using tactic trade unions , was seen as collegiate problems in reaching an agreement between Australian cricket players &apos; union ( ACA ) .
Mr President , Mr Peever , is the former CEO of Rio tinto Australia , and he has asked the CAP to help the head and adviser in the wage negotiations .
However , it would be a mistake to believe that the elite businessmen , whose approach is ruthless in their dealings with criminal players , do not like this sport .
Peever , for example , was a regular visitor of the Sector &apos;s house games until he had moved to another state .
Nevertheless , the tough negotiations between ca and ACA and the extremely high wages have created the impression that Australian pet reference is now more business than the prevalence of sport .
On the contrary , however , the team of Australian Super Rugby , the former CEO of the Nazi , Cameron Clyne , has pushed far too back to its roots .
The people of the Ragbian Union now prefer to break to the suburban stadium in order to look at the game between the amateur teams , while at the same time being beaten and culminating in hot dog .
Ragbilin boasts of having the most qualified and versatile management in Australia , but failure to meet the demands of international partners shows that it is still too much sport to be a business .
There is a problem with governance , both in the ragby league and in football , because the stakeholders demand more power .
The chairmen of both too much , John Grant ARLC and Steven Lowy , have shown that their commercial skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability .
Grant , former Kangaroo , led a successful IT company , but for 20 years was completely out of the game .
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent Presidency .
Too stakeholders , who did not trust each other , decided that no one could participate in the work of the Commission who has participated in a ragby league for the last three years in any way , except as a passive fan .
The pound slid too far into the business side , however , and too many fans have been looking for the saviour since then - someone who has a distinguished past in sport .
CEO of Westphile for Foreign Investments , Lowy quite ffa Chair of his father , Frank , Australian richest person .
The A-too clubs wish to be better represented in the Presidential Congress .
Their owners lose money , but believe that they are as decent as Manchester Unites .
Ironically , the channel of sporting and business ethics expels FIFA to stop the civil war in sport .
The AFLl has its own links with Rio Tintos recently by President Mike Fitzpatrick and the former Commissioner of AÃ  , Chris Lynch , mining giant , and the financial manager .
It is all too proud to take the lead of the state in promoting gender equality , indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights .
Some cynics could insinuate that this is being done by government subsidies in the Bible .
The AFL-President , Richard Goyder , said when he took up the place of Fitzpatrick : &apos; AFL is more than business , given how it helps all these communities &apos; .
Goyder is soon the outgoing Executive Director of Wesfarmer and the first presidency of AÃ  , who has not played the game at elite level .
The former President of Wesfarmer , Bob Every , is involved in the management of Cricke Australia .
The thread running through the appointment of members of professional sports boards is often an exercise in sovereignty over competence .
In the rush to recruit business people , they have forgotten something that could be called a bulwark against sport .
What is more , many corporate heavyweights are not used to intensive media and sometimes also to critical monitoring activities on a personal level .
Something that works in a corporate world may not be carried over by sport .
The Jordanian court enforced a life sentence for the killing of three US military personnel .
The Jordanian Military Court of Appeal imposed a life sentence on Jordan &apos;s soldier last year for the swearing of three US military educators .
The military tribunal last month appointed an airbase in South Jordan for the killing of Americans for a life imprisonment sentence , with hard work , in exchange for an senior senior seersant Marik al-Tuwayha .
Al-Tuwaysk opened a fire against the American carpet by claiming that he had been afraid of an attack on the base .
However , the video on the security camera published after the decision showed that he also continued the firing when two Americans stolen and dragged their hands to stop the firing .
The Uudistesat hala Akhbar , linked to the Jordanian army , announced on Thursday that the military appeal court with five judges confirmed the sentence for al-Qaeda .
Sylvester Stalland takes up in a hospitality role as a series of &apos; Our life &apos; in another season .
The Juhtivproducer Dan Fogelman announced on Thursday , in the context of the Television Critis Association Press , that the NBC &apos;s popular drama champion in the next season is set up by Sylvester Stalone .
The actor turns up as a guest in Kevin ( Justin Hartley ) complicity in films at the beginning of the season .
&apos;Kevin plays a major film and we needed a great deal of sympathy &apos; , said Fogelman .
At the end of the last season , Kevin was busy busy busy in a bizarre filter by Ron Howard .
During this season , we can see that the person participates in the project and also warns relations with his own error , which is being played by Mr Breckenridge .
According to Fogelman , the Stallone &apos; film in which Kevin participates is playing an isafighur &apos; .
&apos;The star of our life , Milo Ventimiglia , who plays the father of Hartley in a series of historian images , was played as a coincidence in the film &apos; Rocky Balboa &apos; with Stalin &apos;s son in 2006 .
Fogelman said that Ventimiglia &apos;s still booming friendship , Stallone , was probably the one that helped to attract a large star to the hospitality .
&apos;We have a wonderful scenario for him .
I believe that this will be a really exciting &apos; , saying Fogelman .
&apos;Our life &apos; will return to the theirs on 26 September .
Mr Harrison spends around USD 300 000 a year to keep his body in play .
Each of these players is dependent on their own bodies in order to earn their living .
That is why many other battles are also investing a great deal of money in the maintenance and restoration of the body in order to stay in top form .
The Jeremy Fowler portal , ESPN.com , looked at how far some veterans are prepared to go in order to extend their career .
However , no case is so extreme as that of the 39-year-old James Harrison , the 14-year-old Pittsburgh Steel guard player .
According to Fowwler , an annual average of USD 300 000 is spent on meal treatment , masculine therapy , chiropractic and pollling .
Most of the costs relate to travel across the country to meet specialists .
&apos;My do not need to keep records of these things &apos; , said Harrison .
&apos;If you compare the sums earned with my expenditure , the payments are worth that , given how I feel themselves &apos; .
Mike Mitchell , a trainer of Harrison , and a team partner in Steel , assessed the annual amount of USD 200 000 as a year of caring for their own body .
30-year-old Mitchell has had to relax the body ( in English &quot; body tempering â , which Fowler described as &apos; 55 kilo of metal used as a masculine &apos; .
&apos;Therefore , Mr Mitchell has said it on your head instead of propagating himself &apos; .
&apos;If you have a few places on your foot and you start moving around to do so , it is sometimes painful .
But , if you stand up , the tension has disappeared immediately .
It simply beat the tension &apos; .
They are ready to make additional efforts , but former NFL-players , Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris , spend an average of USD 50 000 a year on recovery .
Cofield , who played 10 season in the ranks of New York Giants and Washington Reding , has expressed regret that he was not spending any more .
&apos;If I could go back , I would invest even more &apos; , Cofield said to Fowler .
&apos;I would probably spend at least twice as much .
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career .
Until the end , perhaps more procedures would have been helpful &apos; .
Ryan Shazier , a 24-year-old defence player , expressed his readiness to follow in the footsteps of his team partners in Steel .
&apos;If you pay USD 100 000 and if you play an additional three million , that decision is quite simple &apos; , Shazier said .
As far as the long term of the career is concerned , investing in the recovery of players is much more intelligent than spending money on cars and cotton .
The average playing field is lucky if he can play for longer than 30 , all the more so as he succeeds in persuading his colleagues to direct their costs to the other .
But perhaps they can just find some local specialists .
How Prince Diana used her metre as a weapon .
When I think of the Prince Diana man , the first thing comes a bridge before the bridge .
A daughter blue in a young age .
A black line later on would appear in his book of Martin Bashir &apos;s &apos; Panorama &apos; interview , the effects of which were devastating when he looked through the rips of the boxes , bringing the famous dead phrases : &apos; We were married in this life three , so it was a little too popular &apos; .
The great and wet eyes , surrounded by his disdain , conspicuous in the face of a bad line , gave him the impression of being wounded .
That is what he was trying to achieve .
Prince from outside the public , with Diana , never borne a great deal , at least not according to modern standards .
It was not just that he did not need it - he was nice , of course - but he saw a stranglehold in it , something that is related to work rather than to the substance .
In the public domain , he may have wearing a thin meigoh .
Once upon a time , he arrived in the office of publishers of Conde Nile , Vogue , carrying a tank , almost an orange of God .
He apologically asked for his skin to smear off the sun as if he were going out &apos; normally &apos; , he would be photographed by hard photos and then put all the accusations that he would see an &apos; dultery &apos; , &apos; ash &apos; and &apos; tired &apos; .
It is for this reason that Diana was behaving three times a week in an insult , using a machine that is at home .
Today , this would , of course , be reproached for health reasons , but for Mrs Diana , it had a useful objective , which enabled her to show the world its sun , even though her internal clouds had black clouds and cracks .
Probably one of the biggest mistakes of the Royal family was to think that , if they accept him as a husband of Charles , they would get one of the little relatives of a little wound who , for the time , only have a sugar poor .
The reality was quite the opposite , however .
He may not have been best at school , but when it came to creating a miracle , he was a full-blown student .
For Diana , the importance of gender and honey was that it was possible to use them as a fervent or a reason to transmit .
Otherwise , they did not give him any interest .
His friend , Rosa Monckton - a Diana for his youngest child - remembers that we were not something they used to talk about .
&apos;My only remember it &apos; , he said , &apos; how relieved he felt on those occasions when we went out together and he did not need to meal himself &apos; .
Today , we tend to think about a man that improves the woman &apos;s expression , but when you look back on the Diana &apos;s housing scene , it is clear that she used it as a powerful PR tool .
The moments when he felt the most free of all was his own , are the moments when he was also the most natural , wearing very little honey .
In 1993 , together with its two young boys , Thorpe i pargon song Leapi , she was a wake-up call and she returned from the heart , under the banner &apos;s eye , like any other mother who spends a day with children .
Four months after he was informed of his departure and that of Charles , he finally found out diametrically concerned and &apos; ordinary &apos; .
Or , in later years , in stamping out of a stagnant , set up behind the hair , in the form of shoes in bicycles , a face plagued by training , a health and life spillover from his shop in the evening .
Towards the end of his life , when he started to assert his independence and his self-confidence increased , we saw more and more such a Diana .
He committed himself to Halo Trust and walked through the Angola mine field in January 1997 .
At the time , at the age of 35 , hair mills and natural - almost entirely naked - he probably saw the camera as never before , remembering this brilliant and hopeful young girl who , for 15 years , laughed at a pocket .
Diana was just reaching its best years .
In the early days , a young Diana Spencer had the character of a rare Raffaelic language .
However , it did not take a long time until PR started - a process that was dirigeled mainly by the plural and the pale to make a young kidney out of Diana , who would be worth the new state of affairs .
This included in part the work of Clayton Howard , a veteranist man who was often used by Lord Snowdon on photovoltas .
The Howard met with a fearful Dian for the first time in the Knowdon City in order to record an official betting on the magazine for Vogue .
At that point , at the end of the 1980s , Diana was only an empty pill .
His most sophisticated beauty products were in the eye of The Body Shopi , for example Elderflower .
Mr Howard used the Max Factori Judaege , Sheer Genius , at the time Honey Touch and Max Factori &apos;s adultery tone , the Fross Coral .
He put a bag on the Elizabeth Arden toone Rice and Timberland and , to his culmination , with a whim .
The Excellency was supplemented by the Elizabeth Arden Sydne ripsmetuch and by a blue conscription .
And we know all this , because Mr Howard created a fad scheme for him .
&apos;Diana &apos;s eyes are so admirable that I wanted to emphasise their striking presence &apos; , he wrote later .
However , the end result is not particularly attractive for such a young girl - she sees as 18 years of age as being 50 .
His actions are too oppressive and too much eternal brotherhood on the horizon .
The most striking thing here , however , is the infamous hypothesis in this tonic Disney Prince in the tone .
Fantaasiathas to fantasy .
I do not wonder , then , why Diana is looking at us with a little bit of uncertainty .
One of the sources of Diana games was the fact that she never knew where a public persal would end and privacy started .
This was the start of this process .
The person most likely affected by the expression of Diana was Mary Greenwell , who still plays an important role in the modern world .
The Meigunster , who is currently a member of Chanel , among others , is still one of the world &apos;s population clusters .
&apos;Dian had an unbelievably beautiful skin and long loathes &apos; , reminiscent of it .
&apos;he was just a miracle .
He was told by the men .
He was sex without trying to do so &apos; .
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991 , when she asked her to award a magazine from Vogue &apos;s then peastic Anna Harkin before December with the most appreciated photograph Patrick Demarchelier .
The team also belonged to Sam McKnigh .
This was the case when Diana and Charles had the greatest adultery concerns , and the squabbling started in the name of public support .
&apos;they did not tell us who it was , although we knew it was someone &apos;s very famous &apos; , Greenwell said .
&apos;When we arrived , Diana was just fine there , it was soya and friendly , and it was very excited that it could be on the front page of Vogue &apos; .
This captain picture - Diana simple kampsunk , the lunchet relied on his hands , his blue eyes special , cynical French manicyor , the havoc cut for short - was groundbreaking .
It was radiated from a positive , individuality and an elegant .
Above all , it was modern , conveying a clandestine minimalist aesthesis of the early nineties and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the Royal Family , who were faced with &apos; annus horribes &apos; , as the Queen called it later .
&apos;Diana was very straitjacket on its honey .
He simply wanted to see fresh and different &apos; , Mr Greenwell said .
In time , he taught Diana himself as a man - a creet , a cheese creet , a pedaughter to raise bridges , a ripsmetuch - and emphasised a healthy skin routine , encouraging him to take good care of himself and follow the mantra &apos; internal beauty &apos; .
Diana &apos; did everything moderately &apos; says Greenwell .
He smacked enough and reduced alcohol consumption , which is very important for skin with fresh appearance .
The printer preferred the Guerlain Decree , Clarins and Clinique i Wild Rose .
However , the biggest service that Mary Diana did was to alienate her from a blue in .
&apos;This just made him so much older &apos; , he said .
Instead , he used a combination of soft brothers and neutral tones with brown-line line line line line line line line line line line line line line line that was mutually absorbed , with all the margins being fairly soft .
He often used a fine credo and a little sun cat to highlight Diana &apos;s healthy diet .
&apos;Dian used to call me and invite me to discuss products , which I very much enjoyed doing &apos; , said to me by Greenwell .
&apos;I think it was fascinating for him ; an opportunity to take a few moments for himself &apos; .
His favourite was the luxury brand of Clarins .
Diana allegedly used day and night creams for their sensitive skin and their Alpine plants for cleaning milk and tone .
He also regularly went to Janet Filderman in the beauty of Central London .
Dian had a marvellous skin , but sometimes he had a despatch , a moderate span , which is often a result of stress .
In order to mitigate this , he used natural calamities , including bitter oil .
&apos;Dian had a wonderful luxury structure &apos; , Greenwell said .
The only part of his appearance , in which he was not very confident , was his nose .
Ms Harkin recalls : &apos; Once the newspapers have written that she had been to Ninaa in a beauty operation , she turned to me and said , &apos; frankly , if I had allowed my nose to oped , don &apos;t you think I would have elected that ? &apos;
When the advice of Mary Greenwelli and Sam McKnight started to take root , Diana felt more and more confident about its new appearance .
One of his most enjoyable publications - in 1994 in the Serpentine gallery in London , where he carried the famous &apos; retaliatory broker &apos; , provoking , bedded by a figurer oppressed by a whiguit , Mrs Stambolian , shows that she started to turn her into signals over the past years of her life .
With short and overtired rhetoric , Diana is sex and dynamic , in stark contrast to a very challenging black siege .
His meal is perfect - lukewarm but at the same time humble , a black bridge highlighting his horizon .
Without fearing the colour , especially the red , he carried the dose from the dock to the deck , probably the Revlon , which then became a trademark in some ways .
A few months later , he avoided his elegant red manure in the parenthood of the Emergency Fund in the Kingdom College of Justice .
Printer was a benchmark for health and self-confidence .
Finally , he had complete control .
A daily and in a form , his meal , he conveys exactly what he wants in order for the viewers to think : There is a woman who at last seems to have a sense of self-interest and a purpose in life and who has finally found his place , having just 36 .
It is a real pity that he was not able to prove this to himself .
IAAF warns that petitions are being closely monitored at the London World Cup .
The World Cup begins in London on Friday , and athletes are in a more intense light than ever with the doping channels .
These world championships are the first to be dominated by a new body , athletics interit Unit ( AIU ) , which also monitors corruption , gambling and the falsification of results .
&apos;cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen .
We can say , however , that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping programme that can be at all today on the basis of information and data collection , and we will see the result after the event &apos; , David Howman , the AU representative , said .
The AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes of some 190 Russian athletes caught between droom athletes .
Leaking the trump card transcries is probably a federal crime , according to the former prosecutors .
Anyone who leaked transcripts of the telephony between President trumps and foreign leaders on the press was probably committing a crime , then on Thursday the former prosecutors stated when the legislators called for an extradition of the defendants .
&apos;Implementing these documents without authority to the press is a crime &apos; , said by Joe Genova Fox News , a former Columbia district prosecutor .
These various acts , which involve publicising the signs of conversations between the President and the leaders of foreign countries and their transcriptions , pose a serious threat to national security .
The Washington Post report , on Thursday , on the basis of the documents leaked , about the intensive speeches made by the Mexican President Enrique PENA Nieto and the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull .
The Mexican Head of State said he would stop proclaiming that his government would not pay for the border wall .
According to the newspaper , transcripts contained notes indicating that they have been secreted by the Supreme Security Council President .
The Post said that they had integrated transcriptions , &apos; made together the White House workers &apos; , based on the White House and key players &apos; records .
&apos;there is a federal legal provision which makes such unauthorised information available for a criminal offence , a federal crime &apos; , said by the former New York Public Prosecutor , Doug Burns , on a telephone interview .
Even though some of the details of these speeches had already come before the public in February , the disclosure of transcripts marks a much bigger blow to Valgele Mada , who is trying to reduce leaks .
The report was published by chance at a time when the leading figures in the trumpy administration were preparing to step up the public on Friday in order to demonstrate their commitment to stamping out the secretive information leakers .
The Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sesta , the National Intelligence Director Dan Coats , the Deputy Prosecutor General General , General Ro Rosenstein , and William Evanina , the head of the National Centre for Reference and Security , are expected to familiarise the public with the situation at the headquarters of the Ministry of Justice .
It is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice will examine The Post &apos;s leak .
In order to hold anyone to account for this , according to Burns , &apos; strong elements must be proven clearly &apos; .
He said that &apos; there could be some misgivings about this &apos; , referring to the investigation of the former Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , and not to make an accusation of us .
These considerations include the marks and history of the document and its precise classification .
In the case of secrecy , prosecutors will examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in such a way as to adversely affect the interests of the United States .
&apos;If all this can be proven , people can undoubtedly be criminally vulnerable &apos; , said in Burns .
&apos;There is no doubt &apos; .
When it comes to transcripts of trumps , the Genova , who was the prosecutor for spying cases , said that such documents were &apos; usually classed as secret and higher &apos; .
By claiming that these spills threaten the ability of the US Government to conduct foreign policy , it appealed to the Chief Prosecutor of Dienova to convene a federal , criminal panel of masters to find lecturers .
He also said that , in order to obtain the letter of The Washington Post reporters and editors &apos; telephone calls , there should be a trial - something against which reporters would no doubt be protesting .
The UTAH Republican Senator , Mike Lee , said on Thursday by Capitol Hill that criminal proceedings should take place in the case of leaking classified information .
&apos;If you have to find the person who leaked them - you have to be punished and , in addition , you have to dismiss them &apos; , said in Lee Fox News &apos; America &apos; News HQ &apos; .
&apos;This is unacceptable and this should never happen &apos; .
Lee , who worked as a lawyer before being elected in the Senate in 2010 , said that such a leak was &apos; a crime , a very serious federal crime &apos; .
&apos;such a move should not and should not only be accompanied by dismissal , but also criminal proceedings , given that classified information is involved &apos; , said to him .
It was said to Fox News that , at this stage , a Friday announcement by the Ministry of Justice could provide an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , rather than explain certain procedures .
Last week , President Sessions criticised and publicly poused his anger to the Chief Prosecutor , claiming that he has not made enough effort to find lecturers .
&apos;My want the Chief Prosecutor to be much more harsh about the leaks coming from the security agencies &apos; , said the trump on 25 July in Rose .
In Sessions itself , last week Fox News Tucker Carlson admitted that he was not happy with the efforts made to investigate the leaks that have repeatedly been erecting obstacles for the President since his inauguration .
&apos;My was not happy with earlier proceedings and investigations into criminal leaks &apos; , said Sicions .
Even some people who are critical of the President have spoken out against the leaks , saying that such practices are detrimental to foreign policy efforts .
&apos;The transcription of the speech between the President and the Head of State is outrageous , shocking and dangerous &apos; , David frum wrote on Thursday atlanticus .
&apos;It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly - so that foreign leaders understand that they can provide a confidential response &apos; .
Senator Mark Warner ( D-Va ) , the leader of the Senate Security Committee , also said to Mr Daily Beart that the page is &apos; absolutely worrying &apos; and that Congress should examine it .
The American naval base was ordered to be removed from the post box in the surroundings depicting the American flag .
Erus is at the heart of the dispute between the US veteran and the Florida Lord &apos;s Union with the post button covered by the American flag .
Erus , an American naval officer , John Ackert , says he received a letter last week from the Housthwood Association which he was asked to remove or face a punishment from the post office in an surrounded by the national flag .
He said to the WCTV that he was not going to surrender without fighting and that he had made an appeal .
&apos;Considerate to this , frankly speaking , as a bulwark &apos; said by Ackert .
And I think people should fight any form of bullying , especially that .
As Mr Ackert said , his post does not comply with the esthetic values of Southwood .
A US naval steel , John Ackert , said he had to remove his post office in an American flag .
As a result of your approach to the end of the holiday season , we ask you to remove from the post office the symbols depicting the American flag &apos; , communicating the letter .
The trimmings may be outside 30 days , and after 15 days at the latest they have to be taken down .
He said that there have been four years in the surroundings .
It moved to the house in 30 days &apos; time .
The messages to the Housthwood Housing Association did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning .
A neighbour of Ackert said to the WCTVs that the letter was a bit harsh and was not particularly surprised by the activities of the Union of homeowners .
&apos;That is what they do all the time &apos; , said by Mr Stephenson .
In my opinion , this is ridiculous .
Why not be patriotic in one &apos;s own country ?
Mike PATEL said : &apos; This is a veteran who served our country .
It is just a banner of the post .
I do not think this is right .
The house belongs to him , at least that could be allowed .
A letter from the Association of Civians states that Ackert has 15 days to remove , otherwise he will be faced with a fine .
He has not received an answer to his appeal .

Any remedial work for the former agency will , of course , remain in my eyes now , whether it is in the forest or in the field .
The machines and the quality of the works have improved significantly , and everything is happening more effectively than in the past .
At present , reconstruction is mainly carried out in the past , as well as the search for errors and congestion , and as an improvement in them .
In addition , stricter environmental standards have been added to which attention was not paid decades ago .
Building materials have been renewed , such as plastic pipes are now being used in the construction of tramples instead of past iron pipes , and the thermal towers are being used in addition to stoning , a so-called &apos; geotextiles &apos; .

Report : Mueller called a panel of senior men in his investigation into Russia .
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that a Special Prosecutor investigating possible relations between Russia and Donald Premphalania had convened a panel of old men .
The page states that the House of Deputies represents a new and significant step forward in the investigation by the Special Prosecutor , Robert Mueller , into whether the truce or his main advisers held a secret campaign to promote the Presidential Presidential Movement with Moscow in 2016 .
NBC News has stated in the past that , before Mueller , Governor of the former FBI , who is now in charge of this critical investigation , had been appointed , public prosecutors were using the masters of the former national security adviser , Michael Flynni , and a trumpi former head of the campaign , Paul Manafort , as part of his investigation into the activities .
One of the President &apos;s personal lawyers , John DOWD , said to NBC News that he was not aware that Mueller had started to use the full force of the old men .
&apos;We have been working with Mr Mueller and his team since 1 June because we want to get to the bottom of this &apos; , he said .
In the light of the news of the convening of a federalist old man as a whole , we have no reason to think that the President is under investigation .
The NBC News has not confirmed Journal data independently .
The full use of older men is a normal part of a complex investigation , and is not a tool designed only to listen to testimonies , but also to obtain information and obtain data from individuals or companies .
It is a powerful tool that prosecutors may use to apply for prosecutions and invitations to court , and it may indicate that the work of Mueller is far from being done .
The trump card has denied that he or any member of his team had a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign .
Moscow &apos;s officials have also denied playing a part in the surprising victory of the tempo in November last year .
The President &apos;s special adviser , Ty Cobb , said that he was not aware that Mr Mueller had started using a new old man .
&apos;The old men &apos;s collection is usually secret &apos; , said in the Cobb statement .
The White House is in favour of everything that speeds up the fair conclusion of its work .
The White House is fully committed to working with Mugabe .
The former director of the BI , Jim Comey , said three times that the President was not under investigation , and we have no reason to think that things have changed &apos; .
The Australian bank Commonwealth Bank is accused of large-scale money laundering abuses .
On Thursday , the Australian Government accused Commonwealth Bank of large-scale infringements of the rules against money laundering and terrorist financing against the country &apos;s largest mortgage .
The Financial Intelligence Agency AUSTRAC revealed that it has initiated a civil punishment procedure against CommBank in a federal court due to the &apos; serious and systematic non-conformity &apos; in Australian biggest case and the first one where a large bank is accused .
&apos;CommBank &apos;s behaviour in this matter has left unprotected Australian society in terms of serious and lasting financial crime &apos; , said in the AUSTRAC case .
Commonwealth Bank said in his statement that they would investigate the charges more closely and respond &apos; when the time is right &apos; .
The largest Australian mortgage lending &apos; at the right time or not at all &apos; announced dubious facts &apos; concerning transactions in total to over 77 million Australian dollars ( USD 61 million ) , was reported by AUSTRAC .
According to the Agency , the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of money laundering and anti-terrorist financing instruments , particularly with regard to so-called &apos; intelligent payment machines &apos; .
The previous largest case of this kind was linked earlier this year to the Tabcorp Holdings interlocutor of the most popular betting in Australia , who had only 108 alleged offences .
Tabcorp paid out 45 million Australian dollars and is the biggest civilian punishment in Australian corporate history .
The AUSTRACs representative refused to comment on the possible CommBank penalty or whether there may be other banks on the Agency &apos;s line of fire .
The maximum sentence in the event of contravention of the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is USD 18 million for breach of Australia .
Intelligent payment machines are a specific type of bank automobiles that accept both cash and cheque contributions and facilitate the cash for anonymous contributions .
According to AUSTRACs , the use of Intelligent Payment Areas has increased significantly since they were introduced in May 2012 .
The cash contributions amounted to 5.8 billion Australia in the six months before June 2016 , compared to USD 89 million in Australia in the first six months of the launch of the CommBank Approas .
AUSTRAC claims in court documents that cash was paid from a false name , so that income was obtained for drug importing syndrome .
&apos;even after the attention of the CommBank was drawn to a suspect for money laundering or &apos; soothing &apos; in the Commbank accounts , the CommBank did not start monitoring its clients in order to make it difficult and manage the financing of money laundering and terrorism &apos; , the judicial documents show .
The AUSTRAC added that the Commbank accounts were also used to &apos; scrap &apos; , which is a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without actually having to cross international borders .
Two influential women share their record of success .
What do we have in common with Barbara Corcoran and Laila Al ?
At first glance , these women come from two completely different worlds .
The New York real estate camp , Barbara Corcanan , was able to convert a thousand dollars &apos; loan into a 5 billion worth of real estate firm before applying its expertise on a telephony screen by participating in the ABC &apos;s serious living and converting &apos; Shark Tank &apos; of &apos; Investments &apos; .
Laila Ali has been following the footsteps of his father by becoming the most successful female boy of a four-times unwingeable champion , before the roles of the television leader , author and speaker were added to his past .
Despite these unique career paths ( or perhaps because of them ) , both women in TJ Maxx were recruited to help them talk about breaking stereotypes and achieving ambitious targets for the latter .
Last year , T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in the shops across the country and found that 80 % of them felt that society had stereotyped with solid roles and expectations .
Consequently , they have come up with a project called The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers .
Corcanon and Ali know a lot about this ; they may be at the top of their business by now , but the journey there was not going well for either .
Corcoran was mainly awarded a &apos; D &apos; in secondary school and colleges and had worked in 20 jobs for 23 years .
Ali entered one of the most male areas and , on top of that , faced a challenge on his path to try to step up the theft of his father , who was an outmoded ikoon .
These two , to put it mildly , are sleeping through the knowledge acquired by the difficulties .
That is why we sat down with these influential women in order to talk about overcoming failings , coping with success , and our sense of confidence in business and relations .
What inspires do you to do what you do on a daily basis ?
Laila Ali : I am inspired by my personal goals every day .
I have taken the habit of telling things that I want to achieve .
And I look at that list .
I consider myself responsible .
I am , of course , inspired by my children .
I am inspired by my ambition .
I wish to be victorious for everything that I do in life .
I understand that achieving my objectives requires hard work , but I am ready to do so .
My confidence comes from preparation .
So I will take a lot of time to prepare .
Mrs Corcanoran : Like Lailku , the key to my confidence is this type of preparation , but I will not draw my inspiration from it .
In fact , I am inspired by the sheer curiosity .
What happens if I do so ?
What will be left if I do not do so ?
This curiosity makes me rise from a bed this morning because I cannot wait for what the day brings .
If I do not know about it in a few days , I will simply pretend these sentiments .
Then I am left to believe in my own trouble and I will take inspiration again .
Talk about some of the obstacles in your career , which made you even better in the long term .
Mrs Corcoran : For me , the most difficult thing was when my business partner left me behind and my secretary was lucky .
I finished business a year later , but this year in my life - the fifth wheel - was horrifying because I did not have enough confidence to leave .
I felt defeated , there was no inspiration .
However , amazing things happen .
The most difficult thing is to believe in those moments when you are hit by the setbacks .
It was an extremely difficult year to get down to business and start it from scratch , this time without a partnership .
Laila Ali : I would say that my career was the most difficult time when I was involved in boxing , I was at the top of my career and decided to introduce divorce .
I not only separated from my husband , but also from the then Mountain and someone who taught me all I know about boxing .
I did not believe that I could do without him .
So I started to worry about the future of my career and I had to find time to take a step back and say to myself : &apos; You have all the knowledge and experience required .
You have all these experiences in the boxing circles .
You can certainly do it &apos; .
So I set up a new team around me and continued my career .
In fact , it was simply necessary to reach the right mind , as all the rest of it was given a boost .
I did what needed to be done , I had to face fear and have the courage to get rid of my husband and mountain and to continue with my career .
When did you feel that you have really made progress ?
Laila Ali : I felt that I had succeeded in winning my first catalogue of championships .
It was a really good feeling because , when I started boxing , I wanted to be one of the best , unwinning .
I was able to achieve this objective , and I did not win the title of the championship in one , but four .
Mrs Corcanoran : One moment when I felt I had made progress was my eleven year of operation .
I was at the end of the day .
I had earned a profit of around USD 42 000 , which I could not expect .
I went out straight away and bought a new car for both the mother and the father ; they never had a new car ; I allowed the cars to go to Floridas where they had their retirement .
I felt like the Queen of England .
I felt so blindly .
I served much more in the coming years , but nothing has so far been able to offer the same sense of feeling as an opportunity to give my parents something back and cure them with a surprise .
For this 11-year-old period , how could you keep yourself motivated in order to continue working ?
Mrs Corcanoran : I never measured my business by profit , because that was not my aim .
I just wanted to see how far I can get .
I already set myself the dream of having a New York house King on the first day .
And I saw myself amusing as a Pope - everybody is running my finger and goating me .
I had such a small point in my head .
So , when I made every effort every day , every hour , I did not really think about earning money .
In the end , I pay the money accidentally .
But I immediately returned all the money in .
I do not even believe that I had a daunting day at all , where I would have thought that oh God , we would not make money .
I was simply convinced that something would work .
The worst thing that could have happened would have been to lose the company and to become a pretext again .
I will have a good drink and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
Therefore , I do not believe that the great aspiration of many people who have made progress is money .
They have other incentives to spur them .
And the money was not one of my own .
Do you have any advice to someone who has such great dreams but who is being held back by the financial factor ?
Mrs Corcoran : When I started earning a lot of money , I had money to invest in property , but I did not have time .
I was a company in Rajaina .
And that is why I found five different partners , not even specialists in the squabbling , but in different neighbourhoods across the city , who felt the streets and exploded .
I approached them and said : &apos; You know the neighbourhood .
You can find the best building for me .
I will give you money and you will be my partner .
The lesson here is that if you have money , you need people to earn money from your own money .
And if you have a gift , then you could sell it to someone who has money and make money from it .
There are two aspects : Anne and money .
But if there are not both together , nothing very big will happen .
At the end of the day , I - and my partners too - have worked very well over all these years with those large investors that I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find combative people who like to assimilate .
It is always possible to obtain money if you believe that you have an talent and feel better than anyone else in your part of the world .
We are talking about the morning : What are the two or three things that you do every morning , which will help you make progress ?
Laila Ali : I do not know about you , but I have many moments in life when I feel over-burdened , being a mother , a business husband ... all the roles we play as a woman .
I arrived at a point in my life where I really had to put a routine of this morning in place .
I like to rise up and just feel thankful .
Gratitude for uprising , for his health , for his children , for his family .
I frequently write up what my objectives are for next day ; when I wake up , I look at the list again .
Mediastaine .
I sometimes write in a rhetorical context .
I always have a cup of coffee .
And I always do the first thing in the morning , because if I do not do so , it will not .
For me , this is ultimately about priorities .
These are things that are important to me : My spiral , my focus on the universe and God , then training and putting our health first .
Thanks to this , everything seems simple .
I feel that I can conquer all the challenges that come down on my path in the course of the day .
Barbara Corcanan : I put things in order .
I will work through my list of tasks , which is endless and ridiculous .
And I will set out what is most important .
What are the real priorities ?
I will try to live with these most important things .
What are you doing to bring yourself into the right mood ?
Mrs Corcanoran : I imagine I would fail .
Bizarre as it may be .
I think Issand , I fail .
I beg myself and that makes me make more effort .
I imagine anyone who is competing with me - I am very combative in nature because I am one in ten children and we never received enough attention from our parents .
I can be very competitively .
And I always come in too thoroughly prepared .
Over-preparedness will strengthen my confidence .
Laila Ali : It is amazing how confrontational we are in this respect .
We are two successful people , and this shows how different things work for different people .
I like to imagine that I will be successful .
I like to think about the end , which is a success .
I imagine that in the spirit , I actually see it happening .
I see boxing around , fighting , winning myself as a winner and returning to a clothes room , celebrating a victory with a piece of work , as I have always done .
The same applies to meetings .
This self-confidence is precisely due to preparation , however , as the fear in the puck is that I am not going well or that I am not going to say the right things or that I do not have the information I need .
This is where the preparations for the game are , for me .
But I always enter by throwing the end result down .
You have both been very successful in your career .
How will you pass it on ?
Laila Ali : I am very curious to be part of the T.J. MAXI project Maxx You Project because I feel it is an opportunity to do well .
A large number of women need inspiration , encouragement for them to achieve their dreams and objectives .
We are all in the champion .
It is , in fact , a matter of mood and of having the necessary tools , around them with the right people , with the people who have been able to achieve the things that you are trying to achieve .
Mrs Corcanan : One of the things I think I do very well is to inspire people .
I was therefore very excited when I was asked to cooperate with Mr Project .
I will try to take the bar of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward .
Many people are making the start of putting their dreams into practice , but tend to be wrong at some point .
So we are trying to help them to focus on the cause .
Everything we teach is practical .
Sub-standard , even such a simple thing as a liftic speech , everything that is needed to set up a company .
What advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in male areas ?
Laila Ali : I am acting in one of the most male areas , which is half .
It was quite discouraging to come after my father , who was a global wet and an all-time good .
For me , the crux of the matter was actually to find this talent , courage , strength in itself .
The first thing I had to believe was that I could sit around and succeed .
At the time , no one was concerned with the other but myself and I had no provision for restrictions other than those that I had set myself in my head .
If you believe in yourself and find your passion , no one can stop you .
Mrs Corcanan : The road between finding an inspiration and taking a stance like me - &apos; New York &apos;s King of real estate &apos; - and crossing the finishing line is enormously long .
And in this interim phase , which is your career career every day , many talents are needed .
In order to need these talents , there is no need to act with property delays .
I am sure that in the Laila area , too , it was necessary to decide what the right people are , the right Mountains , when to start , when you can finish , how much money you can put in , what you cannot do when you are prepared to work .
These are all subjective decisions .
I will try to build on these efforts a little so that these women really feel &apos; okay , I have understood .
Let me try .
Here I have three priorities .
If they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen , I will be smiling at home in the evening .
What is your dinner now ?
Laila Ali : Too much yellow .
Magazines , books , small pale wine , my day .
Probably on water .
Mrs Corcoran : My night has a small , green wake-up call , because I tried to break the habit of looking at the telephone every morning .
That is why I came up with it .
It was smile .
But it has never worked .
And still stands there .
And my telephone is still at my dinner .
What book do you read now ?
Barbara Corcaran : An eighth or ninth times it says , &apos; How win friends and influence people &apos; .
This is keeping me on the right track .
I believe that this is still the best book written in this area , which makes no distinction between what your dreams are ; dreams cannot be achieved without other people .
And it is possible to deal with this today just as in the past .
I like to recount it from time to time .
This will enable me to get back on track .
Laila Ali : I am studying a dietary school , which is why I am reading a book entitled Nugy-free dieet .
It is about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies .
I am very interested in this .
What is your best advice to deal with successes and failures ?
Mrs Corcanoran : Ignore the pessimists .
They are met in all sorts of different forms .
You have to remove their brains from their vocabulary .
Keep out of the vans .
They are looking at you with energy .
I take the whip as the theatre .
They come at night , they are short of their pockets and they are leaving .
The pessimists are destroying any team in a situation more quickly than you can look the other way , because people who paralyse themselves want others to feel badly .
They are pulling out good people with themselves .
I can perfectly avoid all negative people within the 50 km radius , because my aim is to be positive and to take everything from life and to accept everything that I have to offer .
So why should I want to spend a minute on such people ?
Laila Ali : You have to be consistent .
We start on many occasions with conviction that we are now taking this path .
We will do that , and that is what we are doing .
However , people will not follow it for long enough .
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the final village .
So I think we need to stay on track .
If you feel passionate about something , if you believe in something , then you have to be consistent .
And you have to do the hard work that success requires .
Mrs Corcanoran : You have to work hard to ensure continuity .
Do you know what is needed for this ?
Finalising things .
If you start with something , you stop it .
Many are some skilful builders , but not particularly some graduates .
Chinese Internet censors play a complex game of cat and mouse .
According to the experts , the shift that may affect a large number of users , from researchers to companies , indicates that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet .
&apos;It seems that the restrictions are becoming more and more intense but , at the same time , the Internet is more powerful than ever &apos; , Emily Parker , who has written a book entitled &apos; now I know Who my Comrades Are &apos; on the influence of the Internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China .
According to the experts , China has not yet strengthened its controls and , in many cases , the game of cat and mouse continues .
One day after Apple &apos;s performance last week , people started to spread in the Chinese social media the way to have access to these tools , which are so simple that they can even use a technical stranger .
This included the registration of a person &apos;s application shop to another country where VPN applications are still available .
Nevertheless , Thursday shows that China wants to change the game for the benefit of the cat .
Several Chinese Internet service providers said on Thursday , in their social media accounts , their websites or in our rooms , that Chinese security officials would test a new way of finding an Internet address for services that would maintain or use illegal content .
Once they have been found , the authorities , according to these companies , are asking that Internet service providers demand that their customers stop doing so .
If customers continue , service providers and Chinese officials will cut them off with Community minutes .
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the fake request to comment on the matter .
Studies indicate that in China tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people use VPN-and other types of software to bypass the Great Cup .
Although the blockades of foreign television broadcasts and pornography deter many people , they present little challenges to China &apos;s enormously large web users community .
The Chinese President , XI Jinping , has been responsible for the new elements of internet control over the years , but he has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors in China &apos;s future economic development .
Since cyberspace has begun to play a more central role with regard to the whole of China , government control elements have evolved .
It is difficult to find out the extent of the new efforts , as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly , fearing to be complicit in the Chinese Government &apos;s disdain .
Some frequent users , however , have said that circumvention of restrictions is becoming more and more difficult .
A student who is studying in the United States and returned to China for summer leave said that he had been blocked by the local VPN .
In his own words , he took this period as a kind of semblance away from the social media and he left Facebook with his friends a message to explain why he had ground down as if .
A PhD student at one university in China said that without Google ITA , it has become more difficult to carry out research , even though the university has found alternative printed so that students do not always need the Internet .
According to his own assertion , he has now found a new way of bypassing the Great Turin , without disclosing what it is all about .
Some VPNs still work , according to Chinese Internet observers , and China could do much more to intensify the restrictions .
&apos;We believe that , if the government had decided to do so , it would have stopped VPN much more &apos; , said VPNDada , a website that was created in 2015 , which would help to find VPN for Chinese users .
&apos;If the government had sent out more in its pocket , the Chinese would be much more complicated &apos; , the representative who refused to appoint himself to China because of the sensitivity of the group &apos;s work .
&apos;If they did not , because they have to give people or companies some breathing space &apos; .
China &apos;s online restrictions are often cyclical .
The current climate is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party , which will be held in the autumn by the 19th Congress .
Five years ago , the VPN had unforeseen disruptions at the time before a similar meeting .
Like economic policy or external affairs , censorship in China is also part of a complex and often lacking political process .
According to analysts , government ministries feel pressurised on the eve of Congress that they are effective and able to intervene if there is a problem .
&apos;Therefore , therefore , it is certainly not VPN &apos;s apocalypsis &apos; , said Paul Triolo , the head of the consultation company Eurasia Group , the world technological department .
&apos;a more difficult environment for users to navigate , and new opportunities and approaches will make it easier for China to simply shut out certain parts of the VPN &apos;s use during and in the chosen place in Beijing &apos; , he said .
The Chinese population will learn to overcome these difficulties in an early age .
Earlier this summer , the Chinese Internet giant , Tencent , started to limit the time during which younger than 18 have been allowed to play a popular web game called &apos; Honor of King &apos; , enabling an hour to be done for those who are under 12 and for two hours , those who are aged 12 to 18 .
That is why young people in China have started using a age-old solution : False documents .
&apos;is your &apos; Honor of King &apos; speaking time restricted ?
Are you interested in getting a document that shows that you are older than 18 ? &apos; A recent advert asked in the social media in China .
&apos;There is no problem .
Make the Community available in order to obtain a document cheaply &apos; .
He was praised for obstructing a global cyber attack .
And then he was arrested .
When the outpouring from Krono was first advertised in Russian underground forums in 2014 , the questionable price of 7 000 dollars indicated for this that the sale of bad property was a lucrative undertaking .
The Krono was advertised as a tool for discarding data , including user-name names and parol , PIN-works for cash machines and personal information which is useful for breaking up security issues .
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins was detained at Las Vegas airport after a weekend at the Security Conferences Black Hat and Defcon .
He had plans to fly back to his home in Britain .
The Turbek community reacted to arrest its appreciated star with surprise and scepticism .
Some warned that requirements against Hutchins could undermine the relationship between &apos; white &apos; cracks - investigators who seek weak software points for identifying and solving problems , not committing crimes or freezing chaos - and law enforcement agencies .
Others hesitated to take the view that Hutchin could have created such software as an attack .
In July 2014 , he asked in Twitter , and no one has any face of Kronos , which is a seemingly curious request when he himself was the author of bad property .
Although the exact details of the connection with Hutchinsi Kronos &apos;s theft are not clear , security investigators in search of vulnerable places on the computer code have often ignored legal problems .
In recent years , the major technical companies have put forward a &apos; patchwork of errors &apos; in order to formalise the process of reporting problems and compensating researchers for their work .
There has also been a tense relationship with the law enforcement authorities at the Defconi conference , at the gathering of security experts from all over the world without restrictions .
In 2002 , for example , the FBI was arrested by a Russian chryptic expert in the Las Vegas hotel room following the publication of software , which , according to the authorities , could damage the security of certain types of e-books .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , in his statement , said that he was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and would examine the matter more closely .
Wanna Cry Land contacted computers which worked on the parents of Microsoft Windows .
After the spread , software computers were crypted and users &apos; files were lumped , captive and chain .
When the infected devices were connected with the network , other online devices could also be infected .
The aggressors insisted that the victims would pay hundreds of dollars to bitchen at the address .
The Hutchin became a &apos; accidental hero &apos; .
In an interview given to Guardian in May , Hutchins said that he would register online after he discovered that malignant software were trying to make contact with it .
By registering for the tenor of USD 10.69 , he launched the so-called slaughterhouse , which stopped the proliferation of software .
His original intention was not to stop the attack , but to monitor its spread .
Hutchins , who is a researcher of Krypto Logic , a cybersecurity company in Los Angeles , said in an interview that he was not in the College and had learned to write software for himself .
The company did not make its comments .
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous , in contact with the media with their constant MalwareTech , but British tabloids revealed their identity .
He was praised in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and was given special recognition by the industry at SC Awards Europe .
The trumb described New Hampshire as &apos; narcoura &apos; , thus referring to State politicians .
&apos;The President is wrong &apos; , said New Hampshire &apos;s Republican Governor , Chris Sununu .
It is disappointing that his misrepresentation of the epidemic ignores all the excellent that the State has to offer .
Senator Maggie Hassan , a democrat in New Hampshire , mentioned the comments &apos; disgusting &apos; and said in Twitter that his state of affairs is no different from the others fighting for the misuse of widespread opiates .
Senator Jeanne shaheen , as well as the democrat , agreed .
&apos;It is totally unacceptable for the President to speak of the NHS in this way &apos; , he wrote in Twitter .
It is completely wrong to portray the NH and the epidemic .
Organ addiction - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history .
A drug overdose killed more people than weapons or accidents in 2016 - estimated to be 59 000 people according to the figures analysed in the New York Times - and is the main cause of death for the Americans under 50 .
In 2015 , more than 97 million people in the United States consumed analgesics with a prescription , according to data from the Agency for Mental Health .
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not determined by the doctor .
New Hampshire has been hit hard and its people repeatedly raised the problem with the presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign .
The New Hampshire mark was estimated at 470 overdoses in 2016 , compared with 439 cases in 2015 .
In 2012 , they were 163 in New Hampshire , according to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Services .
On Thursday , Sunu described the opiates epidemic in us as &apos; one of the worst health crises ever faced by the State &apos; .
He said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention , treatment and recovery .
He says that the state has also spent millions of dollars on prevention programmes for children , legal protection to stop drug trafficking and initiatives to make it more accessible for a joke that is used for overdoses .
Disney &apos;s long-time adviser and leader Marty Sklar died at 83-year-old age .
Sklar , who died at his home in Los Angeles Hollywood Hillsi &apos;s neighbourhood on 27 July , maintained contact with the company after a retirement in 2009 , which was precisely due to the 54th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland .
Last year , on the opening day of the Shanghai Disney in China , he became the only truck member ( that is how the company calls its employees ) who has participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world .
And less than two weeks before his death , he took part in a gathering of Disney fans in d23 , reminiscent of Disneyland .
His death was reported by Disney Company without mentioning the reason for it .
He was 80 years old .
The Sklari post as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary , but she returned after Disneyland after U.L.A. in 1956 to work on its advertising department .
He soon became the main shadow author of Walt Disney in writing advertising material , plumbers , speeches , slogans , representations and brief films such as a piece of correspondence that helped the company obtain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florda .
He also cooperated with Wales and his brother Roy on Disney &apos;s annual reports .
&apos;That was rather a pelling times for a person who only joined his 30 birthday and had only six or seven years since the College was completed &apos; , Sklar wrote in his autobiography &apos; Dream ! IT : My Half-Century &apos; Materney Mayc Kdoms &apos; ( 2013 ) .
However , despite his confidence in Sklari in the Walt Disney , he appointed the Sklari pavilion in New York in 1964 , where Disney Company shaped exhibitions and missiveness .
Skelr wrote to Walt Disney for the Medon paviet Magic skyway , where you saw animatroonic designs and coopers , and which was their main connection with large corporate sponsors .
This was the start of the second Sklari intervention in the company .
As a member of ever-increasing importance and leader of Imagineers , he was increasingly involved in Walt Disney , who died at the end of 1966 for a long time before Walt Disney World opened in 1971 and Epco in 1982 .
After he died due to lung cancer at the 65-year old Walt Disney , Sklar was receding into the world of writing when he was told that the company &apos;s leading workers had not prepared public speech , although &apos; it was not secret that the Walt was dying &apos; , as he would write in his autobiography .
Skelr felt frustrated , as he said , that he had to sign a statement to which Roy Disney was signing , but he realised that the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney &apos;s death had been paralysed by the company &apos;s leaders .
&apos;In reality , they were all afraid of death &apos; , Sklar wrote .
Mr Sklahr was born in February in New Brunswick in New Jersey .
His father , Leon , was a teacher and mother , a neiusdar Lilyn Fuchs , worked at Johnson &amp; Johnson , before Long Beachle was in a family walking to California , when Marty was 12 .
After secondary school , she had a number of temporary jobs , for example she worked in Douglas Aircraft , an ice-shirt servant of Hamburgerian drestoran , she served as a beacon for postal services .
However , in May 1955 , when his third year in U.C.L.A. was coming to an end , Sklar received the message that she would call the Disney marketing and advertising leader E. Cardon Walker .
At the time , Skelr U.C.L.A. was the new chief editor of The Daily Bruin .
Walker asked him to come to a job interview for the creator and editorial of The Disneyland News .
Walker said that the subject park will be opened shortly .
And that needs him .
Walker asked for an interview after 20 minutes .
Skelr , however , had to prove to Walt Disney that he knows what he is doing .
&apos;My had worked there for two weeks , and I had to propose a leaflet to Walt Disney &apos; , he recalled on the website of Disney Avenue .
&apos;If he did not like that , he would have extradited me from the door and employed a professional .
Fortunately , however , this enjoyed Wales .
I was 21 .
It was frightening .
I never had worked on a professional level &apos; .
The lessons of Skelr in Walt Disney ( and also some other people ) at one point for a &apos; Mikh Trust &apos; , or a thematic park as a manifesto of the Governing Board .
The calls include , for example , the following : Have a sense of purpose .
As an attempt to &apos; go to the visitors &apos; shoes &apos; in order to experience the attainment that they have .
There is only one story at once in the case of the Judaeta .
In writing . - Bob Rogers , an Emergency Disability expert , called Sklari once a &apos; sorcerer &apos;s apprenticeship &apos; - a role played by Miki-Hiir in Disney &apos;s film &apos; fantasy &apos; ( 1940 ) - because he had brokered the Disney philosophy to three generations of designs .
Sklari is left behind by her husband , a neiuslander , Leah Gerber , daughter Leslie Sklar , son Howard and four grandgrandchildren .
Skelr was a committed leader of Disney .
He regularly carried three target platitudes Miki-Hiire ( which showed him the time in Los Angeles , Paris and Tokyo ) and Miki-Hiire &apos;s golden chur .
And he never forgotten anything he had taught him by Walt Disney .
When Disney Company developed a California Adventure park , Sklar reminded the planners that they would include activities that parents and children could do together , as Walt Disney had demanded .
&apos;I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Wales had the habit of taking its daughters Dines and Sharon Griffiti park to drive a carousels &apos; , said to the magazine The Los Angeles in 2002 , &apos; and the bog had to sit down at a park , and children had to walk their fins and their fingers alone , to drive the pound . This is what we are doing .
He thought he had had a great deal of humour from his colleague .
But why were his symptoms so different ?
At the Thumapoint , he was given a large dose attaminofeen to reduce the fever .
For the rest of the day he was questioned , torn up , sorted and studied .
None of the tests demonstrated anything , but they were not meant to be sent home .
He understood the reason .
For the past two years , he had taken a medicine called an ethanol to treat SjÃ¶greni syndrome .
The medicine reduces the capacity of the immune system and limited its ability to combat infection .
SjÃ¶gren is a freezer disorder - a rather secretive illness in which the body &apos;s own white water fills attack normal spots , as if it were an intrusive body that sow chaos in this case , which produces tears and depths , as well as in some of the species .
Weekly ethanol programmes had been helpful in reducing excessive pain .
But he knew that , because of this medicine , he was quite helpless in a serious infection .
When the atseminofeen started to work , the patient felt much better .
Doctors at a crossroads decided to leave him at night to hospital .
When it comes to the virus , such as doctors &apos; suspects , everything will be fine with him the next day and he will be left home .
When Girard first heard of his new patient , he familiarised himself with infection measures to which those who administer an ethanol are susceptible .
The list was a long one .
The latter cannot be treated before the diagnosis , which is why it focused on pacification of the bacteria .
One bacterium which attacks people with immunity is an additional food additive .
This is often found in pasteÃ¶rised milk and in cheese , and it causes terrible destitution , oxygen and diarrhoea which it did not have .
The paternal disease is another infection which has spread among those who take this medicine , but it did not have the noise and the lack of air .
An even more widespread bacterium Staphylococus aureus may cause excess feeds but , again , it did not have excessive complaints .
Nevertheless , the doctor plans to introduce large-scale antibiotic treatment that would cover all these risks .
However , the patient did not feel bothered to have a serious infection .
Doctors at Traumapoint had not given him antibiotics .
The doctor had the option of delaying the administration of antibiotics and simply watching and waiting , but if the patient had one of the infection that he had read , the treatment would have been fatal by even a few hours .
The situation was made even more complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was allergic to a penicillin , although he did not remember what happened when he accepted it .
This created a relationship of risk and benefit .
The decision , which has traditionally low levels of investment , as to whether or not to undertake antibiotic treatment , will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
He asked a colleague , a second residence , to evaluate the patient .
Mr Girard did not tell my colleague that he was going to take antibiotic treatment ; he simply asked for a patient to be reviewed and to make a recommendation .
My colleague met the patient and agreed .
Although he saw well , he would be virtually defenceless when he was invaded .
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics .
As there has been an allergy in the patient &apos;s pension scheme , Girard should be allowed to test him in order to check whether he is tolerating a medicine that is not a penicillin but a close relatives of it .
Mr Girard asked for a recommendation to be made .
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine , he would have had a blow or his blood pressure reduced .
Neither happened .
That is why he was summed up as a whole .
A few hours later , Mr Girard made a speech .
The patient &apos;s body temperature had risen by 39 degrees .
He was quick to look at the patient .
The patient &apos;s face was scored by the athlete , and his fields were Roma .
Although he seemed uncomfortable , his heart and blood were all well with his blood .
The doctor thanked the advisability that he had given antibiotics to the patient .
He asked for another dose of dog , Tylenoli , and when his patient had to be looked at for the last time , he smacks deeply .
The fever was retreat .
Higine gold and rosÃ©s had disappeared .
The first thing he did next evening , when Girard was visiting the patient for an night shift from a hospital to a hospital woman .
He had received five other patients too , but this patient was most concerned at home by Girard after being handed over to his daily team .
During the hours he had not seen , his bloody body had grown in the laboratory .
It was too early to say what exactly that is .
It was clear , however , that this is a bacteria that is strong enough to allow Petri to grow quickly and that it is not Staphylococus aureus or a millionaire disease .
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit .
It took another two days before they could at last identify the bacterium .
It was a top-down .
Girard , like everyone else who looked after the patient , was surprised .
As a doctor , images of diseases come into their head .
For Girard , an additional philosopher was a disease deriving from unfettered milk and soft cheese , which causes acidification , oxygen and diarrhosis .
He worked through even more material on this unusual infection and found that , although people with a normal immune system could experience these symptoms , they usually recover quickly like a patient colleague .
However , in the case of pregnant women , people aged 65 and those with damaged immune systems , an infection may be unleashed outside the seed wire - sometimes without the usual symptoms appearing - and end up in the blood .
It can spread across a whole body such as the cost .
This type of infection , which is called an invasive additional lottery , may result in death by up to 30 % of patients suffering it .
Indeed , although it is not as widespread as the boil shoot , the lottery may be equally deadly .
Early antibiotic treatment can save life .
If there is a food-transmitted disease , what food did the bacteria bear ?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unfettered milk or soft cheese on a journey , online searches identified an outbreak in Scotland this summer linked to a smoke-free beef .
Neither of them had eaten beef smoke-free , but they fought a slightly smoke-free divide .
Where they picked the bacterium right remained a secret .
Once the medical team had learnt what the patient was wrong , they were able to adjust antibiotics .
His three-week treatment ended in July .
Doctors advised him to finish calmly in the summer , but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work .
No shelter will be found in India , where Pakistan &apos;s price is concerned .
70 years after the greatest population in the history of two countries starting with partition , the prices are still moving from Pakistan to India .
Tens of thousands of people are already waiting in rock camps along the borders of two countries , who do not even have the legal right to work in India .
So many have no choice but to illegally rack down in temporary habitats - the Indian authorities are watching very closely the movements of those who cross the border on the other side of the border .
The majority of the arrivals in Pakistan cannot expect such reception .
There is no work , there is no house , there is no money , there is no fault .
There we worked in fields ; we were peasants .
Here , however , we are being forced to break up the brick in order to earn a living , saying 81-year-old Jogas .
For us , division is not over .
The prices are still trying to return to their country .
And when they come here , they have nothing &apos; , an elderly man living in a foreign camp near the town of Jodhkrak added .
After India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947 , over 15 million people lost their homes .
Partition caused months of violence , in which at least one million people lost their lives due to religious hatred .
In the midst of the bloody chaos , the breathing and straight from the newly formed Pakistan , the Muslims moving in the opposite direction .
Despite emigration , Pakistan is still regarded as one of the most numerous minority groups in the country .
According to various estimates , they account for around 1.6 % of the country &apos;s population of 200 million .
Many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear of robbery , rape and forced marriages .
&apos;The persecution soon began after partition &apos; , said Jogdas , whose family moved only a few months before the two countries departed from droughts to the areas of the current Pakistan .
Not a day ago , when we could have lived in peace .
I wanted to come back to live in the midst of my price increases .
The national government of the Indian Prime Minister , Narendra , has said that it wants to make it easier to find asylum in India , persecuted for religious reasons .
Last year , the government started enabling immigrants to obtain citizenship at their place of residence , in the past , through central government .
In the marks surrounding Pakistan in India , after seven years of residence , the possibility of acquiring fast-start citizenship is open .
However , due to bureaucratic delays , this process is often much more time-consuming .
64-year-old Khanarji left Pakistan in 1997 and obtained Indian citizenship in 2005 .
According to him , however , many have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not looking for a good life in India .
The government offers no support .
We are like cattle without property .
We are simply trying to survive on our own &apos; , saying Khanarji .
But worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities .
Those who do not have citizenship have to suffer harassment from intelligence agencies .
They are regularly treated as suspects and Pakistani agents &apos; , he explained .
Singh Sodhal , based on a charitable organisation dedicated to helping prices from Pakistan , had high expectations of the motto that came to power in 2014 , but now he has had to deceive .
The tension between India and Pakistan has increased under the Mod government , with migrants suffering the most .
&apos;They &apos;s life becomes hell &apos; , Soft Sodhal .
For many , however , this treatment is even better than it is in Pakistan .
Khoroji fled to India two adult boys two years ago because she had started to obtain death threats from her Pakistanis neighbours .
&apos;in order to save our lives , we had to flee to India &apos; , said 65-year-old Khoroji , whose grandparents had come from the current areas of India , but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country broke .
My grandfather went to the other side because of the work .
But he told us that we would move to India at the right moment because he knew that the future would be dangerous for prices .
On Monday , the last opportunity was to put forward a fine name for the ninarvian potatoes born at the beginning of June .
The Loomaednes now have a large cat to review their names in order to find the right thing to do on the birthday of the creative world , to proclaim solemnly on 25 August .
However , Naravans can still be given a name up to their days of stagnation .
Since the beginning of August , the entire Ninarvik family will see walking side by side in a horror .
And while Father Kigyl occasionally runs round round and soothing garden aposte , His Kibibi is not allowing herself to be disturbed , the Ninarvian bar is learning a good lesson .
Although the ears of the birth have passed , on 1 August we saw the bitter light and the two galleries on her .

On Thursday , another Vivacolor paint Day was held in the Animal Basin .
A large number of good assistant paints were painted on a new cable house , horror maps for motherhood and fatherness of the fauna .
In order not to interfere with the paint , Fien and Draay once again spent their time in the company of Library Carl .
On 9 August , on the second clash Wednesday in the Aavo , there will be a troika petitioner for the end of Aavo .
The Loomaia can be buried in remembrance of the ninasarvies and navels of Kruus and other mediums .

JÃ¼ri Kolk : Puhake over a year , so there is no need for leave .
Of course , I was personally guilty of not taking up this leave .
I was also a somewhat necessary worker , but at the same time I think the only one who considered himself indispensable .
It was to blame that I had a lollah sense of duty spread in my front .
The quotation at the beginning of this Chamber is fine in that it is absolutely true .
That was the case : The new agency , which I started in March of the same year , did require a lot of work , but something that fit me so much better that I was eating a completely new life in three months .
We are in a period of summer , of holiday .
It is time to make new annual promises , to review what has happened in life and in which direction the whole thing is pulling .
&apos;If you have the strength and the change of year , &apos; Hinding some decent citizens off the hook &apos; .
Perhaps it is , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas is not appropriate for thinking about life and for setting targets .
Well , I am speaking only for myself : I cannot make any change at the annual change .
This is too difficult a time for me .
Of course , at the Christmas time , there is happiness and joy in the wavelength : I like knowledge of the beginnings of the light , pleasing the Christmas treasures , and Jesus , too , was very much like a sympertic approach , revolutionary .
Nevertheless , during Christmas , I am mostly very tired and sometimes also stressed - for the sake of this blindness .
Yes , I do a great deal of work , perhaps more than I would do in a mammoth slaughterhouse , and I have been constantly pretty clear .
For the most part , I have run as I did before Christmas - gifts , at least four Christmas times , a slightly greater burden at work ...
If we also take into account the unceasing social pressure to feel unconditionally joy and peace at the heart , the difficulties of the Christmas period are obvious .
However , a desperate and tired person cannot make good decisions , let alone improve them as a plan for improvement .
These things still need to be done in more or less clear terms .
A tired person will perhaps throw an empty and resounding promise , which will help to lay the foundations of the future about as much as the purchase of a lottery ticket .
The promise that is intended to change something should be considered calmly , which should be beneficial ; it should be a plan .
The plan , in contrast to the promise , contains not only an objective but also a code of conduct , and does not go a few small setbacks after the plague .
That is why I would say that the best time to deliver on promises is now , in the summer .
It is just a matter of calmly pumping out and of hacking why it is so great ( if it is ) .
If you do not force yourself to sound like a raid during the holiday , a couple of weeks will be enough to find a few places of your life that deserve sickening , and to find out how exactly that can be done .
I think it is important to live as possible in such a way that there is no need for leave to rest on an ongoing basis , not once a year .
So that leave would be an additional bonus , not a stop-gap for survival in which you are parked so much as to be able to withstand any way next year .
I would suggest to everyone that there is at least one simple promise - if you have to rise up at a fixed time next morning , you have to sleep in good time at night .
I believe that if one in ten Postiman listened to my suggestion , life in Estonia would be significantly improved .
I myself intend to follow my own advice .
Such attempts are spurred by people .
It would be very good to think ahead and draw conclusions .
The recommendation to spend a little more time looking at the gun of the willing is obvious .
More generally , however , everyone could have a strategy that they share in the social media .
At national level , however , the question must be asked as to whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers threatening the social media .
The life expectancy of bogus created under controlled circumstances ended with summer school , but the boatloads certainly did not .
The fourth Estonian person got heart in Finland .
In writing . - ( PT ) According to the coverage of the northern Estonian Regional hospital ( PERH ) doctors , Cardiokonter Talis and Cardiologist , Pentt kaldra , who took part in this paragraph , the post-operation period has been calculated as waiting .
&apos;It is very difficult to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart &apos; spoke Holiness .
Doctors claim that they have been living with a heart pump in the world for a maximum of eight years now .
The man himself is still recovering and is not prepared to talk about this .
He was first diagnosed with a lack of heart , two years ago , and the disease had already entered the final stage , and heart was caused by an Islamist war .
&apos;For this illness , transplantation was the only option &apos; , added to Thailand .
According to Kardikero , after a transplant , the patient no longer has any windows accompanying the heart pumps or instructions .
It has only the army and the rogue suppressing immunity left to it .
A patient could carry on sport and generally reproduce like a normal person &apos; , he said .
The first year is the most dangerous .
The sunder added that a full recovery would take three to six months .
According to both doctors , the patient must strictly monitor the uptake of the grass on a regular basis , while the medicines have side effects .
In addition , the patient must carry out checks in order to avoid a knee-jerk reaction from the donor community .
The most dangerous year is the first , but over a decade , according to ISHLT , or the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant , over 50 % of patients live .
Thailand stated that Helsinki has better results and that the longest living has been with a transplanted heart for 25 years .
The Kardiokerg explained that , because the illness caused the patient &apos;s blood breath to be poor , a heart pump was put on him a year ago that helped to recover for the operation .
When man &apos;s lung artery fell , he became an appropriate candidate for transplantation .
The siting operation is not regarded as a very complicated trap by the Tarian &apos;s estimation : The correct timing is very important .
&apos;a lot more time took to get into the wool and then get to the heart when you put a new heart in &apos; , he said .
In addition , the podium surgeon revealed , as a complex part of the operation , that it could be cruelly removed .
Rather , according to him , a heart shift can be considered extraordinary , because that is what the Estonians need least of all .
There are far more kidney , liver and lung transplants .
There is still an excitement about what is going to happen , but we have been accustoming this work for many years .
Learning to know oneself and their nervous system is one art at the office &apos; , adding Thailand .
The body needs another four people .
The patient claimed to have had a heart because no other patient in a country that is part of the Scandiatlus link was a body that was not fit .
Scardiattrian is an organization with members from Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia .
There are now four more people in Estonia on the heart transplants list .
&apos;That is , after all , numbered patients &apos; , emphasised the Holy Land .
For the longest time , in the TV , there are large men with a carbon-positive boom .
&apos;Finland has a queue for this for around half a year &apos; , he said .
There are also a lot of conditions for heart .
&apos;Opportunities do not suit a woman &apos;s heart , the heart of a great human being small and so on &apos; , attracted a podiokoner .
There is no need to look at a good fertiliser by far - between 7 and 12 August , the consumer will be in the central town , directly at the whip , the film festival tARTuFF .
A particular feature is its focus on love films .
The programme also contains films that represent the darkest side of love , see both new urban works and the old good classrooms .
Numerous special events in many places make a week out of the university city as a film .
All films are free of visit , there are up to 1 500 seats , and this year an area covered with an artificial butchery will be directly outside the screen , thereby temporarily creating a ferry for the city &apos;s central square .
In Switzerland , the largest fertiliser in Europe , 8 000 visitors can enjoy the film at the same time .
The heart of the Locarno film festival will be the Square of Piazza Grande , or Great Square , from 2 to 12 August .
During the festival , a number of representations are taking place , chaired by recognised refrigerators and subcontractors .
When an accident arrives , a shortfall of between EUR 15 and 20 will have to be bailed out for the benefit of one film .
The Pula film festival in the Roometto , Croatia
The Gladiers , the blood , the shouting crowd , the other bearer , this picture opened in Croatia 2 000 years ago in Pula amphitris , where the film at the summer night in July is now enjoying an international audience .
For the first time , an outmoded Roomet-day building was set up in 1953 , making the Pula film festival one of the oldest fertilisers in Europe .
Under the daughter , the good films have been enjoyed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor , John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley .
The price is symbolic : The night in the Mediterranean Basin , with high-quality films , means an expense of about EUR 3 .
Sala MontjuÃ¯c &apos;s open-air cooker , Spain .
Along with this film , Sali MontjuÃ¯c has a wonderful view of an open-air cinema .
Indeed , it is in the desert MontjuÃ¯c , in other words , on the Jewish hill , in Barcelona .
In the evening winds of Southern Europe , the rock of fortress seems to be the whole Barcelona Term , which is the value of watching on its own .
The organisers erecting the Valxravi sopp will July to a big screen showing the well-known films from La Lord to Manhattan in 1979 .
At the same time , the gift owns up to 2 500 people and EUR 6.50 has to be proposed for entry .
The ticket price also includes an open-air group just before the film that is permitted to enjoy next to its long journey .
Anyone who does not want to sit down or has forgotten to have a long way down will be able to borrow a bedroom for three euro .
Cinema &apos;s stars , Italy
A real nostalgic Italian soul will be experienced in the middle of Bologna , where the summer dinner shows the cumbers recovered by the local film archive .
The old films have to look at 3 000 to 5 000 people , alongside the tenth largest church in the world , the San Petronio base .
Mainly the North-Italian buildings of the 15th century enlightenment , with summer night warfare and good compassion , are creating a romantic atmosphere in which every stone is melting the north .
From 19 June to 15 August , there is a new film in front of the audience every evening , and all this free of charge .
The Bologna philosopher festival , under &apos; cinema stars &apos; .
The film festival of the Viini Mine Remotion , Austria
Viin is a music world , showing Meka , and even films : The film festival at the Channel House of Austria ( Wiener Rathausbaz film ) plan is exclusively for group conversations and musicians .
5 000 free seats will be completed from 30 June to 3 September every evening , just like a miraculous one .
Apart from the classic music stars - the Placido Domingo and the Vienna Filharmonie groups - offers festival picked in the morning jungle .
A special feature of the film ups in Vienna is the love of good food - in addition to world-class music , you can enjoy the roses of the best restaurants .
Every day , from 11 to midnight , there is an open food and drinking area that offers traditional Austrian flavours , as well as skins from Asia , Greece , Italy , Mexico and India .
Comparison of the fastest spathways : From the ÃÃ¶club &apos;s tickets to saunarithms .
The consumer editorial compared the more favourable packages offered by squares to one person for a night from 11-12 August .
&apos;Spaahotel is at different levels and different choice of services , so one comparison only on the basis of price is very difficult &apos; , spoke of Mario Sau , the head of sale in the CIS .
Compared with spathological accommodation , it turns out that prices for the most favourable packages vary several times and that options are to be found for both a more demanding customer and a more modest wish for a buffer .
For example , if a passenger is able to spend EUR 51 in a single local room of VÃ¤rska Spa , in a single seat of the water centre , buffet-dinner and breakfast , and in unrestricted use of the water park , the power force and the floor , then when visiting the concept of the PÃ¤nes operating in Muhuland , the cost to one person of the package will be EUR 287 .
It contains accommodation in the category of Double Delilx , the restaurant of breakfast in the talent of Alexander , and the &apos; load and irrigation &apos; coffee package from one and a half days .
When opting for and compared with different packages , it should be taken into account that , in order to have the best price , the holiday should be taken with a friend or compassion , because double meals are more advantageous than taking a single farm .
If , however , there is a desire to rest on its own , then double tobacco is offered to the visitor according to the visitor &apos;s seat .
If , in general , an uninvolved passenger has to pay a few dozen additional charges for staying in a two-state seat alone , it will be possible to find more favourable options if compromises are made .
For example , in the Hague , FRA Mare Thalasso Spas , the package will cost EUR 86 in a single local room on dinner , but it will also , if it so wishes , offer a more favourable opportunity to eat in a double room on condition that someone else is accommodated in advance when there is a lack of space .
In that case , the cost of the package will be EUR 58 .
It is worth being flexible in order to obtain the most favourable diets .
Package prices are dynamic , that is to say , they will depend on something that is coming from a week .
&apos;For the most favourable package , the prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 248 &apos; , and Mr Triintera , the sales and marketing leader of Supply in Spaatelli , explained their pricing policy .
He , too , pointed out that in their hotels the price would be variable , depending on the performer , and added that , as a rule , the customer would get the best price by booking directly to their website or asking for his own offer .
As the summer period is the quickest for the skins , it is worth planning time for leave in order to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold .
For example , only svides have been selected on 11 August as the time of comparing the packages , both in Put Hedon Spas and in Strand Spa and in the conference hotel , and also in Vienna in the Laheland .
You do not need to look far for opportunities to spend a lethal leave : Almost every larger city in Estonia finds one or so many squares .
It will be worth investigating this before the package is bought , and at the same time there will be no major event in the vicinity , as this will immediately lead to prices soaring .
For example , to 11-13 August , the Hague is taking place in White .
At that time , the demand for accommodation is very high in Haiti , and we have the price of major events at the time .
&apos;Therefore , we have no accommodation in the sale at the time at a preferential price or a favourable packaging &apos; , commenting on the spaahotel wave in President Irene fields .
&apos;Approval American &apos; under a &apos; crusade &apos; .
Of course , I have heard about &apos; flying &apos; ships .
Who would not be ?
After all , many times , Tibet is between Tallinna and Helsinki .
It is nothing special .
The Swiss company Supramar placed the first &apos; foil &apos; boat , Freccia d &apos;Oro or Kuldse on the market in 1952 .
The technology was there before , but now I have a mobile base before me on the wind .
Katamaran , yes , but there is a slippery slope .
What formula should this take up with ?
Let us , however , save ourselves lying ( it is not difficult to find it ) and take the view of the simple farmer of the concept of &apos; fooling &apos; .
Why do aeroplanes stay in the air ?
The face of the wings is that , if an aircraft drives ahead at great speed , the air that flows under the wings and over there , is creating an aerodynamic increase because of the difference in terms of the pressure , at some point it exceeds the weight of the aeroplane and begs the whole mass of air .
In essence , the same process is taking place in error .
The right wing is creating strength to move forward at a high speed , and that in turn raises the &apos; incentive &apos; basis out of the water .
Simple , surely ?
It is difficult to get to the figures .
A plane needs a minimum of between 150 and 250 kilometres per hour to take off , and the world record for drink speeds is now &apos; just &apos; 121.1 km / h &apos; .
However , let us not get caught up in the physical fabric of secondary school .
Today I have come to look at a &apos; flying &apos; directory bearing the name NARAF20 Carbon FCS .
NACRA comes together with a list of headlines from North and American Catamaran Association .
FCS is a brief word from Flight Control System .
It is a system that allows the team to settle in the middle of the &apos; flight &apos; too , and 20 show the drink &apos;s length of the jungle .
As soon as the Catalan is freed from the roofs , it is clear that this is not a gentleman &apos;s Holy Lunk .
Dr Monokels and Captain Salis remain in the roof today .
The Bible and the glasses were not on board .
That is a bonus here .
That is what is going on in the Presidence of Cuba .
&apos;If you give me a cool ? &apos; I ask you to give you a cool .
Yes , it is all carbon .
&apos;He the whole bag , then ? &apos; I do not really understand .
&apos;No , the whole boat &apos; , the answer is meagre .
170 kitchen - the three of us who go on board will certainly consider more than 170 kilos together .
I compare everything from washing to dinner cars and I will not get around here - NACRA &apos;s f20 is like an unsuitable breast on the street .
Pagan Zonda R or Ferrari FXX .
Built with one specific objective - to drive well , well and well quickly under controlled conditions .
The disloving hobby soldier would also be hunted down by the amount of security that has to be carried out before going to the sea .
A watertight suit , guerrillas , a captured boat , a cool , a rocket , a special bail-out , a chip .
The litany has the feeling that the oxygen is on top of the sea and as well as the sea , could also colonise Marssi .
&apos;is there a high likelihood of going around ? &apos; I ask a joke .
&apos;Yes &apos; , there is a brief answer .
&apos;You have gone a long way ? &apos; Sondetin the surface .
It is clear that this cannot be a joke .
I would like to confirm a safety bell .
The Sihtostatball is also emphasised by the fact that Nacra f20 FCS needs a hell beside the sea and a minimum of two crew members .
A maximum of three , so there is not much room for manoeuvre .
We are starting to see why this is not a Sunday square one .
Australian cruelty : From highgrading to school .
From the indigenous national abnormal towers , modern Australian kitchen has inherited dolppies and bailed meat .
The British roots have also had a great impact on the desk there - for example , Veglete , ferret salt beer , smelt for beer to sah or Greek , reminiscent of the British Marmandi .
The honey is also in the pound , or in the lethal surrounding pig of meat , which is offered with potatoes and cats , comes from the British .
There are also BQ Snages of UK origin , or the raw materials that the Austrians mature on the gril , the British , rather greed .
One local dessert is a Pavlova beseetort , although it is also called an inventory by the new-nage .
Magusa is still loved with code-tails and cat belongings for Anzac-backusides and cococoshelbe-chocolate pigeon .
Honey Joys , in other words some joy , is called the honey-sore Palace .
Australian copynity , Stephanie Alexander , and his life work , a compatriot of the homeless , which is at least half a million at Australian home . / Blake Storey , Prius Creative Media .
In the autumn of this year , Stephanie will celebrate his 777th birthday .
His father was a public official and his mother , Mary , very much loved food .
Stephanier learnt a library at university and , as Australian young people used to do , he went to discover Europe after his studies .
In France , Stephanie &apos;s food love was only obsessed and developed .
In London , however , he met his first husband , Jamaica &apos;s roots in Monty , with whom they opened a simple dietary seat in Melbourne in 1964 , The Jamaican House .
Ten years later , the marriage broke out and the restaurant closed the doors .
In 1976 , he opened a restaurant for a slightly more prosperous nation , Stephanie &apos; s Restaurant , which was one of the most priced meals of Melbourne for the next 21 years .
The important restaurant in March still speaks of as the first Fine dint in Melbourne , which really was able to value fresh raw materials and provide seasonal food - a fact that now appears to be the aabysaic truth , but it did not exist at all at the end of the last century .
After the resignation in the restaurant in 1997 , Stephanie has focused on writing the house books , 15 of which have appeared closed .
There are productive food writers in Estonia , but in his case , no book has been just a collection of prescriptions .
For Australian homes , different Stephanie Alexander &apos;s coffers have been irreplaceable .
For its life , however , it has to have a fifth draconian , a supreme &apos; The Cook s Companion &apos; , which is now at least half a million at Australian home .
The book first appeared in 1996 , an improved output in 2004 and the latest version in 2014 .
In my library , that is what makes quite a lot of room for the expression of 2004 , because there are around a thousand recipes in the wonderful book on 1126 pages !
The latest scenario , however , is even more extensive .
Stephanie Alexander &apos;s life work : &apos; The Cook s Companion &apos; ( &apos; compatriot of coin &apos; ) is at least half a million at Amy in Australia &apos;s home .
This is a real carbon dioxide which , in addition to prescriptions , deals with the purchase and storage of different raw materials , introduces food-making technologies and makes recommendations for the purchase of vegetables .
Foodstuffs are in a staggering order , and there are also many cross-references in the works - the education of library on the food writer clearly did not run down .
Stephanie himself points out that it was this book that changed his life and gave a new direction to future affairs .
The sense of the popularity of the book that it has something to give to people led to the next large project , the vegetables , which in our circumstances are comparable to school facilities .
RASMUS MÃ¤g : The preparation has not gone as far as I saw in my mind .
&apos;Not everything has been directly as I saw in my mind &apos; , talked about the training before MÃ¤g .
On Friday , there are important points which show how exactly the body is .
And competition will show what we are doing here .
On this day , I believe that my preparation has been of high quality , both in this year and in previous years , so that all of this can be run normally .
Something specific has not been dealt with since the championship at 13.05 of Estonia on Sunday , after the domestic championship .
In recent weeks , training often goes too far .
I should have , and it may be very helpful , that the last week before the MMi-was slightly easier .
Physically speaking , the days that remain at the beginning are as follows : Yesterday , the truck float , today is taking a warming trend .
However , he does not want to go into his mental preparation : &apos; Let me have my own routine for a long time .
There is a lot of silence and peace , and I am not allowing some kind of rock music to my ears .
I do not need to look at any motivational videos or to read suicide books , but be here and , at that point , assess the possibility that athletes have come together around the world to compare their abilities in one place .
This , in itself , is creating a special nature .
The mm is , of course , one year at the top of every frivolous league , and MÃ¤g has every previous launch , including the contest in the Tyansquare , having tried some of the technical nuances , compared with a few competitions .
There is no longer any scope for experimentation in police contests .
&apos;That is simply the aim of running fast &apos; , it is talking about the MÃ¤g , but it adds that , if you dump ahead and potentially the semi-final , you manage to save even a percentage or a couple of energy , they will definitely be in favour of the next drink .
For the first time , it is the founder of the Central Party and the ideological cornerstone of the elections .
So far , we said the Central Party and we thought of Saemete or vice versa .
Now the Middle East has to find its way without him .
In so doing , they also have to crush between the colour of their party , at times the criminal and embarrassing past , supporters of the Saetiare party and the expectations of the electorate .
The exodus of Sates puts the Central Party in the most difficult situation in an ideological context .
On the basis of the existing political practice and ideology , you can say that they are firmly overtaken by the old finarvik .
A number of maps that previously have an effect as trumps may not materialise this time .
The Populismikat for the Central Party is not working , because Saemear can always promise more than the Prime Minister &apos;s party .
Playing on the Russian card is difficult , not only because of the position of the Central Party in government , but also because here , too , we are seeing the Svinova electoral union sink gas .
The perimeter &apos;s card is already in the Sakenare pocket as a result of the ongoing trial .
For the Central Party , the map of the people and the poor has also disappeared .
The first is its undeserved , and the other is being hampered by coalition partners in the government .
However , one card may be even more significant .
All the last elections have confirmed that it is the parties that can formulate and implement the basic structure of the elections that are successful .
The main conception of an altitude is precisely around the Saeb .
If some political parties are supposed to breathe life into a well-functioning confrontation , the map of the Central party is once again lacking .
What will be left to the Middle East ?
They have a strong party apparatus and a considerable resource available to them .
The noise must also be enough in the run-up to the elections .
After four years of self-advertising with taxpayers &apos; money , the vast majority of talents have now , I hope , been paid back to them .
There is still the city media in Tallinna , but the practice of party guerrillla journalism is even less there .
In addition , the party has a magnet of votes .
Their role will this time be to bring them out of the fire , because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate voters considerably .
In ideological terms , Mr Ratas has to find his way , because the road to the savage ended in this week .
Father Weeil : A man broke in a foreign car on a train to sleep .
Yesterday night at three o &apos;clock , police officers met a slightly selflike challenge .
Indeed , a Audi owner reported that in a tank located at Port Arturi , a stranger man has climbed into his car and left to sleep .
The patrols that responded to the event found a man who , on the arrival of the law enforcement officers , picked up as sleeping .
Namely , the man on his journey was tired for a moment and found his place in the back seat of an alien man &apos;s car .
&apos;The man picked the law enforcement on his own feet again &apos; , describes the Western Prefeckon Facebook .
All the good , all the good !
Video : The Vasilyev has already created the second penal for the new club .
From Pias , the match already remained at the ninth minute against WrocÅaw Slask , but was able to grapple 20 minutes later .
In the past , there was a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the Piast season .
Four minutes before the Northwest Passage , the half-defender passed his pensioner .
The match ended with 1 : 1 fig .
There have been two items accumulating from the Pial four rounds , and the ranking ranks are at its last , or 15 .
The most stupid questions to ask the bar .
Huffington Post brokeres questions that they would rather not like to hear are heightened by the BahÃ¡ &apos;i .
Which drink can you best do ?
There are indeed more ingredients in some drinks than in others , but the same skills and skills are needed to make them .
&apos;What is often interpreted by backers as &apos; What is the simplest / fastest to prepare ? &apos; , which signals that the client has whatever he drinks , whether or not to make it difficult for a bar .
What kind of drink do you most like to drink ?
This issue is interpreted in the same way as to which cocktail would be the easiest way to get away from the Baha &apos;i right now .
It is not for the bar to say that , but for the customer to make the decisions themselves according to the beaches of their pocket .
Rather , the basic elements would wait for the question of whether there are any specific offers at present .
What good is being offered here ?
Perhaps there is a genuine desire to know whether the base is differentiating with any offers from others , but that could be asked otherwise .
Nor can the bar anticipate what the customer might prefer at all .
Could I have a drink that would not be very sweet ?
There is a same rule here that the base man does not know your taste and your preferences and , for one , it may not be for the others .
However , he is prepared to listen to what landslide the coffee might contain .
Does this drink give me a headache / shop ?
In the Bar Islands , there is no media or predictable and you can promise the customer , have no hand at heart .
The police will search the Estonian sun under the post card .
Europol hides a stamp in the Tallinna kitchen .
The Russian citizen Ernest Gammer , who stabbed a foreign man in the Tallinna Road Club in 2010 and caused severe damage to his health , has received the list that Europe has sought the most needy .
The Belgian authorities were already aware of the contamination of eggs in June .
&apos;When we knew at the beginning of June about the potential problems with the Pedproniel &apos; , the Belgian spokesperson for food security said the VRT television channel , Katrien Stragier .
We immediately began an investigation , and we also talked about it for the public prosecutor &apos;s office , because it could have been a fraud .
From there , the investigation became secret .
We understand that people have health care issues and we are trying to respond to them &apos; , added Stagier .
The news agency AFP attempted in recent days to get information from the prosecutor involved , but it did nothing because the investigative judge banned information from being published .
The Channel has been withdrawn from the precautionary procedure in Belgium until the results of the analyses become clear .
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from marketing in the Netherlands and Germany .
The German Minister for Agriculture , Mr Schmidt , has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to clarify the matter quickly .
&apos;somebody has obviously polluted eggs with a product that was forbidden in a criminal manner &apos; , Mr Schmidt told the German newspaper Bild .
According to the Estonian Fish-Food and Food Office ( VTA ) , the contaminated eggs from pesticides produced in the Netherlands are probably not in Estonia .
&apos;According to us , the Dutch eggs in Estonia are not &apos; , the VTA spokesman , Martin Altraja BNS , said to him .
He added that there are no other Dutch egg products produced in Estonia either .
According to the statistics agency , eggs from the Netherlands have not been imported in the last 10 years .
The most recent mention was made of monks from the Netherlands in 2006 .
The Dutch authorities suspect that pesticides on fironage reached hens due to the Dutch company Chickfria &apos;s attempt to cure the chickens affected .
Reports in the Dutch and Belgian media that the substance containing the pesticide reached Chickfriendin through a Belgian company have not yet been confirmed .
In larger quantities , the fipronias , according to the World Health Organisation , have moderate dangers and may have a negative impact on people , particularly children , kidneys , pay and hake .
How do you keep excited when you try to have a child ?
It is therefore very important to keep a brick wall on the wall even when you try to create a new life .
Fether First is advising how to make sure that the good does not seem to be a tiresome commitment .
Take away that as an obligation .
This may be the case for any couple trying to get pregnant .
Sometimes contraception can take years .
Beatings take away spontaneity and romantics .
Try to be spontaneous !
Women often feel unable to enjoy the &apos; ordinary &apos; sex cycle at the end of the sex cycle when it is known that there will be no positive outcome .
This creates tensions in this respect , which in turn will lead to a reduction in the sex , and less sex will , of course , mean an even greater possibility of not being pregnant .
However , men feel that they must be able to &apos; speak &apos; if they are required to do so .
If you know your fertile days ahead , it will be able to support you in order to plan something romantic with more cost .
Be it a special dinner or just spend time together - enjoy each other !
Take a fertile period into account .
From the point of view of reproduction , there is no point at all in mixing when the ovine has been carried out , but in order to have your couple warring , try to sex after a few days in unproductive days .
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy takes place more firmly , if a woman is orgasy , it is still forgotten !
It should be remembered that each couple are different .
Everyone can do things differently with regard to the fine game stress .
Some men want to be aware of a woman &apos;s cycle , while others prefer not to know that they do not feel pressurised by &apos; demand to speak &apos; .
No one knows better than you how best you are .
Find your own solution .
Studies have shown that the highest rate of success is for couples who interact every few days , but not every few are able to maintain this density .
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you best as a couple .
10 underground advertising lines which make the appearance of food more attractive .
Since it is difficult to squander many foods , the picture uses a very different ingredient which deceives people - like litre or potatoes instead of milk .
YouTube , the YouTube channel , will report which tricks are fairly widespread in the advertising world .
If someone opens a popcorniak in advertising or picks a hamburger out of a box , a lot of savage will emerge from it .
The reality is that the butter is longer and , in all its time , the heat of the food is not evaporating , because the holes come from a high water content , which , for example , is not available in products .
That is why cotton batches have been leaked into packaging or food , with the capacity to absorb and keep a lot of water there .
In the immediate vicinity , they hire much longer than Burger or poppy , and the product comes fresh appearance .
The potato is a great abyss for photographs , because it does not turn into a melting pot or a thermal melting pot , and it does not fundamentally change the configuration of the like many other foodstuffs .
For example , instead of a crew or a potatoes or ice ice sheet , there can be a potato .
The odd colour and decorative elements and the consumer have been beaten up again .
The EU is replacing milk .
It is not easy to squander milk either , because the fog does not see it as white at all .
Also , foodstuffs stowed with milk will quickly become washing inside it .
Since , for example , the mortem or the moud must be seen in the milk and the grubbish are used instead of milk using a litre of libel that does not run through any generosity .
If restaurants can make a great deal of effort to produce meat , so that the result is both quantum and fertile , it will not be advertised .
However , the meat that has just been presented in advertising looks particularly attractive as if it had come directly from the gril .
Often , however , it is snowed on the banner or greed and drifted into the meat with grillllit gnite tribes with shoe .
It is just as difficult to work with peace as it is with ice because it tends to meltdown .
Fortunately , there is a product that is almost identical in scope to ruin - a soldier custodium .
Therefore , it may be in advertising on the shelf or on the shelf or within milk cocktail .
Even on the supermarket basis of the fruits on sale in the shop , there can be an aerial layer which makes their appearance more sophisticated .
However , this is not enough for the fox , and it is a deodorant that is being sprayed on it to add slurry to cotton .
Measurements are also not very spyentine because , for a time period , they become liquids or , for example , they release water .
Here , however , we can help with the passage whose private colours and more permanent telephony make it possible to make a tempting istute .
The arrest has probably also been used on the pictures where a meltdown of chocolate is flowing on the head of the cake or ice cream .
If you notice a school with ideal perceptions in advertising where biscule was taken and the exact relationship is ideal , there are apparently some extra layers or battles used there .
This is because you can break the cake and upset the picture .
If , after being cut down , you push in and spray pieces and spray them over the top , that makes a visual impression .
The carcasses and nitrogen needles are also used in the burgger to pinpoint all the ingredients there in order to sustain them well .
That is why Burger does not stand up as it did in advertising .
The paper was knowledgeable chicken .
In advertising , greed is seen as a meal and an adult , but it may not even be ready for maturity .
In order to add an adult &apos;s impression , the chicken will be topped with paper , if necessary with the potato bear I mentioned earlier , and then the chicken will simply be sprayed with the colour of brown .
The Panncos are pocketed in particular in American advertisements , because this image creates a high level of poppy in people &apos;s minds .
In fact , the cogs inflict into the hospital quickly , and the flowing transfer pig disappears quickly from the door to the photograph .
This is why every banner is being sprayed by means of a deterrent for diesel , which helps to prevent rapid infiltration .
It is often not helpful either , and so the gold bride is resorting to motor oil that is dumped on the boys &apos; scores and presented as a transplant .
In the U18 cases in Estonia , the British Right and the A-divoma cannot get off the hook .
The match started at an extremely rapid pace , and the first quarter that the British won in five ( 18 : 23 ) were thrown a lot of repeating .
In the second quarter , the gap increased still further , and there was a lack of progress in terms of rest breaks , with guests in the nine-point ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia was able to win a third quarter , but with just one point .
The loss of Estonians before the last 10 minutes was eight-point ( 46 : 54 ) .
Estonia &apos;s game completely broke down in the fourth quarter and , in the end , the loss had to be received with the numbers 61 : 75 .
The loss crushed the Estonians &apos; hopes of reaching A-14 , as only two of the best collections will be able to get there .
At tomorrow &apos;s third game , Estonia will be faced with the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel .
The head manager was living on a song , the song was taken to Tallinn with a chip .
Ivan was able to play to the end when he was affected by a welcome .
The ambulance of the ambulance masquerading his heart for several decades was apprehended &apos; speaks to Indrek Ditmann Elu24s .
&apos;The delay came in the plan , but the festival continues &apos; , says and adds : &apos; The public has been informed , of course they also saw everything that happened in the Gulf &apos; .
At the moment , Ivan chip is on the way to Tallanda and it is not known whether he will survive or not .
Of course , we hope for the best &apos; , Ditmann will say in conclusion .
A spectator told the life of the West that the whole would be affected at the time of Denisenkot .
First of all , the man stopped singing , then the pilot game started to get round and the man fell on the wall .
It had a conferry Jan Uusaga who asked if there was a doctor among the pub .
A little later , he asked for a Denisenko to be praised for .
Ivan Denisenko / Augustibels
Ivan Denisenko , or Ivan Blues , is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure .
The Ivan musician path began in parallel with artistic studies in the Ukrainian national art and architectural academia .
He was immediately enthused at a university about his unbelievably deep bass and invited to song Kuldne Vekuv , known as Polklahs .
He was a friend in a leaf with people who introduced the bonus to him and who later became his band .
The first group of the band called Ivan Blues &amp; Friends took place on 31 December 2007 in Kiev called rag-Timi .
Since then , the band has been operating on a regular basis in clubs , conglomerates and schools across Ukraine .
One more thing : Levadia broke the Paide Linnamese Protem in his home field .
Levadia has put itself in a difficult position because in the previous round , it was surprisingly lost on the future of Vilja , and the Tamil leader Flora made use of this opportunity by slipping into seven points .
However , on a par with the Levady , the cowardier has reached the same straw .
The Paide who has been imprisoned during the summer transition window with make-up will continue to miss the captain and the medium-speaking troika from Andre Folov .
The last seven games have been nourished by just two fig points , the magic table is in the eighth place - Tartu Tartu , with four points , and the future in front of four points in turn .
For Levady , the first batch in the street in the Pans lost 0 : 7 and 2 : 5 .
The Central Party does not want the Sikeare Union of election .
The leaders of the regions of the Central Party across Estonia made an appeal to the public and to their party counterparts , calling for a &apos; Central party &apos; vote , not a &apos; electoral union &apos; .
Above all , this message is aimed at those who are thinking about the EDGAR Savetare electoral union and the Central Party .
We have done a great deal for Estonia &apos;s success .
The Vice-President of the European Commission , Andrus Ansip , in an interview with Kroes , said that he had a sad look at Estonia &apos;s everyday policy , as the government of JÃ¼rr Ratas has been grappling with a simple and predictable tax system .
The magazine used the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia &apos;s success and what I can be proud of .
I am delighted that we have been a good team in the government and that , in the months we read , we have made many important decisions , many of which have been awaited in Estonia for more than 10 years &apos; , wrote today in the social media .
The level says that these decisions are , for example , a tax reform for increasing people &apos;s incomes , pension reform to ensure a decent retirement for the elderly , government reform to offset Estonia &apos;s development , an increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and , of course , health care for available and high-quality health care .
&apos;Well you have a good holiday ! &apos; Was written in the address to Ansipi .
It is worth calculating how much sugar is in milk products ?
&apos;According to EU food labelling standards , the packaging can indicate the amount of hydrocarbohydrates and sugar , which is nothing short of white , so-called desalkru , &apos; , confirmed by Valio Estonian marketing director Krista Kalbin .
He says that there are actually three types of sugar in dairy products : The milk lactol , the natural milk beet , the fruit gilcose and the fructos , and an added sugar , or sucrose .
However , bearing in mind a few simple basic concepts , according to Kalbin , it should not be difficult to calculate the amount of sugar added in the product .
First of all , it needs to be clarified whether there are milk products or modified milk products .
In the normal milk and milk drinks , there is approximately 5 grams of a natural milk cow , or a lactose of 100 grams per product .
The milk products that have been hit have consumed part of the lacuna during the acidification process , for example , which has resulted in an acidified dairy product for an average of 3.5g / 100g .
&apos;To calculate the amount of sugar added , the first one to calculate the sugar in the lactol &apos; , said Kalbin .
Now it is necessary to calculate the fruktos and glycoses from the quantities of sugar .
&apos;generally speaking , fruktos and glyaled milk products have a normal 3-4 % share of fruit in the normal range of 3 % and , in particular , in brands ca 15 % of crop content in products up to 1.5 grams of 100 &apos; , said Kalbin .
According to him , this simple calculation shows that the amount of sugar added may be up to double the amount of sugar indicated on the packaging .
In the case of bee-free products , the situation is slightly different , because in their case , sugar is dependent on production technology .
A 101 year-old man jumped from a plane .
The quarter of World War II , Verdun Hays , recently received a military honour to commemorate a paracid act that had broken his world record .
Indeed , a man committed a 101 year and 38 days of age in prison , thereby getting the oldest person in the world carrying out a steelder cut .
In anticipation of the finishing emissions from the air : Will Gerd Kanter make the history of Mi ?
This mammoth is for Kanter , and none of his competitor in London has achieved that achievement .
In addition , the Kanter is the only heretics through a history that has won a full set of honey medals ( gold , two silver and two piles ) Men .
Today ( from 5 August 2017 ) , Kanter is 38 years old and 92 days old .
If he turns himself into a double world champion , he will be the oldest potato winner Mil &apos;s golden meal .
The Polish army , Pjotr Malachowskil ( 34 years old and 60 days old ) , have a similar opportunity .
More exciting facts :
The world champion of carbon emissions has come on more than one occasion from only two countries &apos; athletes .
Germany has nine gold medals , Lithuania two .
The record of the World Cup belongs to the name of Virgilis Alena , which was hosted in Helsinki ( in 2005 ) by 70.17 .
The lowest result won by the wings is 66.20 - it was done by Riel ( 1991 ) .
Why are the dogs pulling their eyes down ?
At times , it is thought that a dog will eat a meal if he does not know that well and wants to make a mockery .
In fact , the majority of abundant feed dogs are completely healthy .
Only less than 10 % of dogs who seem to bend because of a few diseases .
One of the reasons why a dog can suddenly start breaking down could be nutrient , poor food stocks .
Those dogs who have religions can also take a greater interest in appearing .
Therefore , if a dog that has not broken in the past has suddenly grown up in the wheat and often eaten it , it is worth going to the doctor in any case , so that the potential problem of soya organs , for example , is quickly picked up .
It is worth pointing out that a dog can also be broken because it likes its taste or is simply durable .
If a health problem is ruled out , it would be worth ascertaining that the family &apos;s favourite will continue to be sufficiently developed and desperate .
More than 200 people were hunted down by the police during the Weber .
In total , more than 20 crimes were recorded in the town of SÃ¤rt in festival days .
There are grounds for linking around half of them with the use of violence to the presence of a large amount of narcotic substances and two drink driving .
The misappropriation initiated by the population was mainly related to the use or possession of underage or prohibited substances for alcohol .
Some theft and violations of public order were recorded .
Police stations brought more than 200 people to justice for a variety of reasons .
Of these , one and a half were underage , and mostly the reason for driving the police station was alcoholic drinks .
The bubble was half as far as minors were concerned .
One and a half hundred people were taken , that is to say just as much as last year .
According to Andres Shuman man , the leader of the police station , Mr Sman , the numbers mentioned above are waiting for a large crowd .
As we have done in previous years , we have prepared thoroughly for this weekend .
We have included prifects , police equipment and aid police officers elsewhere to ensure that we are ready to react quickly .
Most situations were resolved with a word and enough of policing with the citizens .
&apos;Shuman said that there were not many bad things because the police were in the city and , in our view , felt quite a lot &apos; , Sman spoke .
In his opinion , it was extremely positive that underage people who had alcohol were obviously less and that young people proved to be in a position to celebrate .
He commended the high-ranking team of the security company , who took care of the security of the festival area .
I would like to thank all the festival men who apprehended themselves in a polite manner and put their brakes in a safe manner .
&apos;also , thank you to the local people who , with their understanding of the attitude of the great festival , contributed to the success of the great festival &apos; , was a policeman .
The Holy police station expects owners from the city at the weekend and from the festival to have been found .
According to Mrs PÃ¤nika PÃ¤nna , the leader of the service in the Festival , who was responsible for relegating the findings , this year there had been fewer formulas lost than the soil .
Festival was returned to the owners on an ongoing basis over half of the sites in the police screen .
The biggest losses in three days were bank cards , identity papers , mobile phones and taking .
&apos;Therefore , at the moment , the owner is waiting for another 13 mobile phones , three bags , laptop computers , smart belts and several car writers &apos; , listed as PÃ¤na .

In the United States , two workers from the elite universities were arrested following a national hunt .
Professor Wyndham Lathem , a 42-year-old Northwester , put himself before the police in California after being searched by the police .
Andrew Warreni , a 56-year-old employee of the Oxford University , however , received police officers in San Francisco .
Men are suspected of bolstering the 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau .
He was found dead at the end of last month in the Lathemi Kicago .
A few days later , under the name of death , suspects made a major contribution to a single library .
Before handing over to the police , Latham one of the police officers of the police sent a video to friends and family members talking about the greatest error in life .
The video of CNN did not see and it is not published by the police .
According to the police , this was a cruel murder and his body had been converted due to injuries .
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Great Britain , but the researchers have not ascertained whether and how he was familiar with the victim .
Both suspects escaped from the state before they were arrested .
In Australian waters , 3 US naval vessels were lost in an air accident .
The US naval force and the naval force stopped searching , reported by Camp Butler , a naval base in Japan , basically confirming that the army would not be able to recoup the disappearances as alive .
The accident happened by the Osprey MV-22 nail plane , which launched USS Bond tomorrow from the Richard parade .
There were 26 on board planes , 23 of whom were able to find and save .
A plane crashing into the sea was involved last month in joint studies between the US and Australia at Shoalwater Bay in Queensland .
Australian defence minister Maris payne said that a Saturday incident occurred off the coast of Shoalway Bay .
The south-west Japan is preparing for a typhoon in Norway .
A large part of south-west Japan , including the regions devastated by the rainforests last month , was prepared on Friday for even more hatred when the typhoon Noru , one of the strongest storms in the world , spanned ever closer to the main islands of the country .
According to the Meteorological Agency , from the south-west Kyushu Island , the Amami archipelago , approximately 1350 km from the Tokyo , on the south of the bedroom , has strong winds and heavy rainfall on the lings of beaches and , within the next 48 hours , it is possible that up to 800 mm sadecdecins .
The spokesman of the Meteorological Agency said that Norway , which stands for certain types of fear in Korean language , would then probably turn to the north and afflict the rain over Kyushu , although the island &apos;s sections hit by rain and floods that killed 36 people and left four missing last month are likely to escape from the worst .
&apos;This is an extremely slow storm &apos; , added , noting that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding , as there is plenty of rain in one region for a long time .
Noru , which was a Tamil tariff at some point and is a routinely long storm , first formed two weeks ago and swept across the Pacific , before moving to nature , targeting Japan and weakening its approach .
The representative added that , depending on the change of course , Norway could go straight beyond Kyushu and then bypass the Japanese Honshu island , but it is still difficult to determine the longer-term journey .
The plane marked the perfect image of the US over itself .
The pilot led to the internal passenger aircraft over the United States and was even able to relax the route slightly .
The aircraft &apos;s real-time airport data indicated that it was not just a straight line or a clothes line , but an airport station that formed an aeroplane combined with each other .
Lend BOM004 left Flightradar , in real time , 24 of the Boeing Field airport , at around 15.40 on Wednesday .
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the direction of the east to Montana , Northern Dakota and Minnesota before changing its course drastically and flying to the edela .
In view of the map , an aircraft &apos;s strange route represents a passenger aircraft with two engines .
In the words of Boeing , the flight is part of an 18-hour &apos; resistance &apos; test of the aircraft .
&apos;instead of flying to a random pattern , the test team put their imagination on a route made up of 22 domiciled by the 787-8 contress &apos; , said to Boeing Company &apos;s representative RT.com.
&apos;Dreamliner nina refers to the Pule Soun region , where Boeing Commercial Airplans have a home .
The wings range from North Michigan to South Texas close to the Canadian border .
The Shunt relates to Huntsville in Alabama , he added .
Bulgaria &apos;s long-distance painter of 787-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009 .
A plane can hold up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometres .
As the pilot used the radar as a personal beacon , the flight generated an outlying interest among the aircraft controllers on the web .
Some suspect that it was a thin flight ; others once again suggested that it might be a strange coincidence .
A former soldier was sentenced to prison for murder of a pensioner suspected of sexual abuse .
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreatment of his own acquaintance .
In June , Richard Cassiy ( 70 ) was found guilty by the Glasgow Supreme Court of David Farishi ( 75 ) at his home in Tweedbank Roxburgh of being defeated in February 2016 .
Judge Lord Summers called the murder &apos; particularly brutal &apos; , because in the body of the victim there were 14 tornado .
A national defence lawyer , Brian McConnachie , said it was killed by a &apos; current madness &apos; , but he described the facts as &apos; extraordinary &apos; .
Cassiy heard that Farish had been sexually abused by one woman for a long time .
His lawyer said that a man went home in Farishi and &apos; friendly &apos; to him in the hope of hearing confessions , not with a plan to kill him .
Lord Summers stated that Cassiy showed signs referring to the intention on the day of the attack , and pointed to a report on social work which showed that the accused had undergone special troops training in the military on how to infiltrate a group by friendly .
No charges had been made against Farishi .
It was reported in the court that , after the murder , Cassiy itself contacted the police and appealed .
McConnachie stated that most people have &apos; difficulties understanding &apos; that Cassiy is capable of murder .
The defence lawyer said : &apos; He has never had any problems in his life before this incident .
He lived as a full life until the moment of this insanity in February 2016 .
Cassiy &apos;s health is reportedly poor and has been hit by heart and mouth while he is in custody .
According to Lord Summer , when he sentenced a minimum 17-year prison to life , he took into account that Cassil did not have any past convictions , and what he allegedly said about Farishi .
The Scottish police described the case as &apos; a particularly heinous murder of a male people in her own home in the mother mother &apos; .
The researcher , David Pinkney , said : &apos; Although this punishment does not undo his atrocity , I still hope that it will offer David &apos;s family some kind of solution &apos; .
Prime Minister JÃ¼rri was today visiting the fourth largest island of Estonia in the context of a trip to small islands , Vormi , where local leaders and residents met to discuss the current issues of the island &apos;s life .
A tour of the Vorman Island was born from the port of Sviby , where the Prime Minister was welcomed by the Vormi Valley Valley in Tanel for a continental shelter , and the Chairman of the council , Ivo Sarapuu .
The first was a visit to the historic Church of St. Olavi and to the delocalised fish , which is unique in Estonia in terms of its own sins and sand limbers .
A study of Vormsi &apos;s nursery primary school followed by the director Age HÃ¤lvin talked to the Prime Minister about the school &apos;s life and the arrangements for school pupils to have a part of schooling .
In 2015 , the Prime Minister added to a new and modern operational service in an open spirit , in addition to meeting the island population .
The debate dealt with important issues for the population , such as the development of shipping and airlines between small islands and the continent .
The country is committed to ensuring regular transport links on small farms with permanent existence , but increased traffic during the summer period , for example , also makes important journeys for local residents more difficult .
These are places where a state can take local concerns and needs into account in an early life and in planning process &apos; , Prime Minister said .
In addition , the issue of the construction of the port of small vessels , the education of interest , the island &apos;s safety and the capacity to rescue it was discussed .
Today &apos;s Vormsi visit was the last part of the small island of Prime Minister &apos;s visit to familiarise themselves with the island &apos;s living environment and to discuss issues that are still to be resolved with local residents and local authorities .
In July , the Head of Government , Saareland , Kihl , Ruhl , Abruka and Vilsand , and during the month of August , he has visited the Nistrian , Prangling and Aegna .
The cold summer has prompted the Estonians to travel abroad to such an extent that package journeys are not only expensive but have been sold regardless of price .
Low-cost air tickets and last-minute tickets would not be worthwhile ; let us think about travel plans for next year instead .
At a press conference yesterday , the EDAR Saetirean , a member of the National Electoral Union , Olga Ivanova , said that the Sebrew Electoral Union would offer the Central Party healthy competition in the autumn elections in Tallinn .
However , how likely will the EDAR Stakear judge the cooperation with the Urma Country Electoral Union &apos; Tallinn &apos; ?
The U18 Commons Arrangement , Vaido Rego : The Play-off-game may be decided by one or two vies .
In the U18 elderly circles &apos; corps , Poland was defeated by a quarter of the B-diviton , home in 68 : 63 , the main contractor Vaido Rego , said that this was a veritable sticking py-off meeting .
The game was a iron .
Both of the tides had done their homework , the points that came hard .
A fact that has better nerves comes in .
The Play-off may be a game of one or two wheels &apos; , discussed the Rego .
Victory , but the trainer first seeks to improve .
The murky always gives it .
Some of our mistakes were not justified , the opponents were readily free and survived on them .
This has been the case before - if you are aggressive in defending them , you risk overstretching .
Let us draw our own conclusions &apos; , utter Rego .
He used nine players today , and Robin Kivi , who was injured by a few meetings , was still stuck on the ground .
These decisions are made on an ongoing basis .
The fibre made the breakfast with the training and pre-toy insulation , but was still not 100 % complete &apos; , explained by the Lead .
Tomorrow , at 18.15 , the Estonian semester will meet with Great Britain , who humiliated Bulgaria 76 : 73 .
The winner of this game will push his country &apos;s U18 elderly section on EMI A by next summer .
A woman found a stranger in a washing machine - to whom could it belong ?
&apos;When I started to withdraw the machine , when the sore washing machine between a rubber gimmick in my eye , a woman is talking about how she found a stranger in her washing machine .
In fact , Karin , in his first care , did not take the slurry out at the door .
I have made a machine go again .
&apos;At the top of the two small children , this undetermined laundering will immediately &apos; , sleeping for the woman .
When the second washing procedure went through and I started to take out the washing out , I still found this kind of bright washing machine between a rubber in my eye and then found the puppet there .
The name of the man who was married 14 years ago - Tomi - has been graved as a gold fragile .
As no one knows what it is called a man or a woman who could be married with a few Tomorrow , the friendship is complete mystifying .
She studied from an old child that she might have found her courtyard , put into her pocket and that the friendship had entered through her washing machine , but the child stated that she had not brought her finger home .
Karin has lived for a year in the street in Tallinn Madala , with his life complicity .
They were selling it out in the past , and then the washing machine also came out of the time .
But if the finger should have anything to do with the tenants , how did it get into the machine ?
&apos;Therefore I am out of touch and cannot understand the path taken by driving a washing machine &apos; , a woman is smiling .
As the life rate on the sidelines of two small children is quite quick , we forget at the beginning of the clock at home .
&apos;Last time there have been postal deputies looking for the owner of the barring of marriage , and now it seemed that it is high time to look for the owner of the war that he found , refers to a case in the social media in Karin which the outbreak in Tallinn was happily taken by the owner last week .
&apos;because various things are found and searched in Facebook , I was the first to try luck there &apos; , Karin , whose post has already been shared by nearly 4 000 people , speaks .
&apos;Postition has received any feedback and not everything is good &apos; , he is threatening the woman by indicating that his first comments were recommended to take his man on his side .
Then the feeling was that it was necessary to do so .
Since my man has become the biggest deceit we have heard .
Frankly , I was concerned about that at the beginning , but later on , when the comments came out that I , perhaps , had become scattered with a gun , it had already made a mockery .
The co-presidents also suggested that perhaps the finger had reached the other round in the pocket of clothes .
&apos;Well , most recently somewhere six months ago , one other round , purchased in order to work , flying in a washing machine without more in-depth research , but is it really ? &apos; She is discussing the MPs ?
Be that as it may , we have agreed with the partner that now , in principle , we have to find the owner of the war .
Whatever the reason for the loss of the war .
Divorce , family class or whatever .
I think that this is the only right thing to do , because if I ever had to lose this marital feeling , I know that I would be most grateful to a person who would try to find me and return my valuable property .
Karin has also appealed to the Agency for Families to get the support there in finding the owner .
I had the answer , however , that Estonia had not been helpless on that date and by a name .
One of the sisters has found the owner .
Recently , the marital assassination found in Tallinn Pelgurann on 21 July , which a grave promise to presume to be an old woman , was happily returned to the owner .
&apos;Jalt the morning with the dogs , and I noticed the outbreak behind 53 houses , inside inside inside the bail-out , the golden sister &apos; , Gerl says that graver allowed to assume that it was an old woman .
Gerl placed a photo on the Dear ( cloud ) on his Facebook sheet and in a group &apos; marked in Tallinn &apos; , shared information with the city of North Tallinna and the Prefect of the North .
In two weeks &apos; time , the police contacted Gerl and reported that the High Representative had been identified .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , &apos; I had had had the owner &apos;s daughter in contact and on Monday evening he left the daughter in the sham &apos; , because the old woman had washed her hand and dried her hand over her hand , where she had burnt down .
&apos;he lost it the same day in the morning when I walked with his dog &apos; says Gerl .
From time to time , the forest will have to be beaten for whatever reason .
However , if there is a split between the skin , it is the right time to make a modal drink .
There are enough resources available for this in the forest .
The home of protection will make a small appraisal .
What we are talking about is a drink , because a coffee contains some way , which is a virtual effect to some extent , but is not the best for our health .
Plants found in free nature must always be prepared for testing , as both prescriptions and tastes differ .
Some of them do not need to fly for a long time , they only need bully water , while others have to be taken to the hour .
Of course , it must also be attentive to the fact that water and plants are safe enough .
It is also very much dependent on the time and place of the year of cleaning .
We will now look more closely at how to make some simple journey and what impact these can have on us .
Road of migration oxygen
A road of migration can be a god for a year calmly .
If 2 litres of water are good a day , then that road is good to satisfy the need for C vitamin and , on top of that , to provide a little bit of extra energy .
Just as with all plants , it is possible to get some useful elements from the games towers using alternative methods , for example by breaking them - the thugs need not be bogged down with the hot water and , for some hours , not cutting .
Half a litre of water takes 0.4 litres of oils , which have to be cut by 15 minutes .
The result is a drink in which there are nearly 25 mg C vitamin , a lot of caalium and a tammetic .
In addition , the drink contains around 1.5 sugar bulbs , or ca 20 kca sugar .
A make-up can always be added to a coffee and honey in order to improve taste .
And once the drink had a bear , it can dilute it with water like a transplant .
Making the cocktail route is the same , but the drink itself tastes a little different .
The Vartel Road is excellent and is helping against a great many woes , from a journey to a whistle of wheels .
The Var Islands is helping to overcome fatigue , has a painkilling effect and will help in the case of refrigerated diseases , both as a deterrent and as a deluge of the fever .
Consequently , it would not be worth more than half a litre a day .
The Varikajan is also time to kid , so winter should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it .
To make a drink in the winter , you take fresh whales , you use cows , networks or marches during the summer .
For half a litre of drink a little pun of paradise is needed , which has to be stolen until the water has a red meal .
The Vadic assets can also be pulled out .
To do this , the shelters and keep them in warm water for a couple of hours .
Longer and more in-depth work also makes the drink more stubborn .
A completed pig of wheels may also be added to the playing field .
A snuff cut
Mustnut is a coose which , in nature , looks like a black beet in the village of a tree .
For the most part , it is found in the boxes , but also elsewhere .
This area of use is very broad - hot drinking , fire to arson , viral instead , etc .
Ash can also be washed very well .
A cut-off path is a kind of supermarket drink that can be used to treat a great many diseases , even cancer or leniency , to heighten tones , to reduce stress , to increase life expectancy .
Seen contains a number of unique compounds and a lot of vitamin B , as well as antiothesis and a little mineral and protein .
The roads made from Seens can be cheese every day , there is no risk of over-consumption .
In order to run around 3 x 3 cm will be enough in a special procedure , which will have to be offered in 2 to 3 litres with between 5 and 15 minutes .
A woman walks around the world : My day &apos;s budget is USD 5 !
I , too , have had this experience , it is true , for 40 days , where I decided in southern France to live a &apos; mad &apos; life in order simply to be free and to live on a single day .
It had a dressed tent , a wild , a small town in stations , and so on .
The second week I joined in a French &apos; homelessness &apos; , 44 year-old men .
Oi , do not think that some pedestrian weights vars : We were just playing the same parg in Menton and we became friends , although he was 15a parent of me , was a good business .
It turned out that a man was a good family , Paris , a former French naval officer .
The Alkot does not use , the sun does not , in short , a decent person , an intelligent , pleasant person to have seen life .
I joined him and followed him for 3 weeks . We were in the middle , in the city , and also in the fodder for about 5 years .
The money was still coming , so long as it was alive .
The man taught how he could evenly offer assistance in the steel and sealed farms of closed hotels and restaurants .
We worked hard to get feed money for the next 2-3 days and then on ...
At some point I stayed with the fever and decided that there would be no more ...
I took a flight to Helsinki , home .
And , by the way , I still regret it .
Those 40 days were probably the best in my life .
A recent reference was made in Facebook : &apos; The quotation is a poor recital &apos; .
That is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done in history to reproduce human nature and what results have been achieved .
I do not assess whether these tests can be regarded as a success or a failure .
I also avoid excessive indications of sources , although I may dwell on the point made by my most important teacher , Toomas Paaul : All my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere , if only remember where exactly .
The most striking step-by-step step step work in this Estonia is the re-education of the citizen of the Republic of Estonia , a perfect person .
We do not grow him as we grow a child - in good faith that he gets a man .
We grow it as the ruling class imagines it - which one person must be allowed to live and speak out in Estonia .
Censorship is perfect .
Although the local ruling class changed partly a year ago , some farming methods are just as horrifying as those of the previous ruling class , the now impoverished address - their brutality does not bode in the least to their previous ones .
They are quite simply different .
Latvia &apos;s beer is the march of the beating mouthpiece of a new era .
Mandatory for national leaders , 0.5 prototypes .
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who get paid from the state for their work , but also those self-aware who freely do politics ( read : Intentionally ) : Write , using the image of Mihelt , by means of opinion flagships , by engaging in Facebook , when the terrible people living around them in Estonia , who are devouring them , are boycotting , campaigning , vandoising , sabotaged .
They are only willing to be in ECHO Chamber ( the English language about people living in a room where there are only suitable opinions for them , such as their own Facebook friends , etc . ) , but this is not possible in the conflict in Estonia .
There are still some complications who think or do something that is unbearable for the hijacodium .
And there is the war of words unravelling and business cannons are mystifying .
We have a number of politicians who know exactly how many people can sleep with , many children to make a job , a lot of pay , how to rest , what to eat , how to dissolve , when you are ill , how you die .
Very important places .
If there is anything else that these public speeches say that they are obscene , offended in hysteria .
The fact that people in a number of European countries are driving with a &apos; full head &apos; , and that is permitted by the law , does not undermine their opinions .
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every area , but behind zero tolerance is not caring , but it is a scapegoat .
Class hatred and fatty - only those like me sound .
The Pyrenetic politicians can open only mouth , but never mind .
They believe that every &apos; measure with which they improve society works and is worthy of the test .
Luckily , we have a kitchen , a kitchen of sufficient size , a kitchen with mental disabilities , who jump through every window - without knowing the pain .
It therefore seems to us that , if a clever peasant opens his mouth and is beaten for it in a few quarters for an emotional error , that is reasonable .
A few words that will certainly bring us into the space of one winter are , for example , tomorrow , a refugee , a woman , violence , work and so on .
If you believe everything that self-serving officials , activists and politicians ( only a small part of all groups , but they can kidnap in such a way that the whole of society is saddened ) talk and writings , the citizen is not only disgusting , arrogant and unpleasant , but also unstoppable .
But do not believe , do not coerce , do not prohibit drinking .
The Estonian person , in any case , drinks as much as he wants , and not as much as the state allows .
The Estonian person will , in any case , tolerate more if he is not forced to tolerate .
The Estonian person will not change his behaviour two months before the elections so that , if they achieve the objective , they will not only turn their backs on the popularity diet and then have their feet again , but will also drive out what will quickly restore the unpleasant brain drain .
Who does it differently is not the right way to go .
I do not believe that a single person can be recovered .
I believe that one can teach a person .
To drink sensibly , to love my family , to be a hard-working , polite , a high-profile partner , not only for friends but for the whole of society .
Teaching does not always have to be penalised , restricted , forbidden , forced to order , conquered , whipped away in the media &apos;s stigma by loading them .
The teacher must set an example .
A policyman who is sitting is talking about tobacco losses ?
A policeman exceeding speed will punish me for being too quick ?
And , then , between my colleague with his head ...
I have the riot idea that perhaps we should try to bring the ruling class around once .
Tell them not to run in secret .
Drinks , drink in public : In a squabbling , in the eyes of the whole people .
To force speed to overrun in public only - the cars of the rulers , including private cars , be they red .
If you rule , then govern as if you govern yourselves .
Maybe then the shame is enough if words and actions fail .
Or can we know that we ourselves want to be governed by those most abhorrent .
Because all of us , the Estonians , are the ones that we do not want to be at all at all .
Where do you flee your own way ?
This weekend allows rain to occur , which is why it is a good time to take up one decent trend .
Why not trimmings .
&apos;RE gorgeous &apos; shares recommendations for nine habits , which should help you to achieve more secretive and better tones .
It is claimed that the first changes should be seen after the first tranche week !
A bus driver saved eight months from the motorway without knowing that the dogs actually have the owner .
&apos;When I put these eight months in , I would have been whipped up by a woman , along with a dog , and a joke was made by a bus driver Oleg , who got round the clothes of a crowd with no ex-post surveillance by the vehicle , handing them over to the asylum worker .
However , asylum was soon revealed by the owner of the dog , for whom it was incomprehensible why the images were taken away from his home .
The bus driver of Chargoland , Oleg , has said that he has worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s , but this has not been the case before in his career : &apos; I travelled by bus to 146 of my traditional route .
Near Harton-Risk , I noticed that there is something small running around on the road .
I thought it was a handshake , but it turned out to be just four cutons &apos; , a bus driver reminded us .
He got a grip and stopped a bus full of passengers in order to pick up the scenes .
&apos;Honourable , cars would have overrun them and had their dogs crossed &apos; , said Oleg .
He added that passengers were reasonable and that soft dogs were also offered to them with great pleasure .
The guess initially feared slightly , but then became a pleasure .
On board , the bus driver went to a new front because the timetable needed to be followed .
Once again , by travelling through the invention of the pupies , he saw a further four small dogs there .
It was a German sheep dog .
They were so prompt and it was immediately apparent that they had been looked after .
The dogs were nice , downright shocking .
The first point , of course , was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason , and the bus driver said that , for that reason , he decided to pocket coaches .
&apos;Let me take those four months and appealed to the police &apos; was a reminder of Oleg .
Law enforcement officers contacted Tallinna on animal asylum , the staff of which came to the coffers according to the Baltic plant .
But was a bus driver not tempted to take a kitty for himself ?
That was the point .
One Kosopoly was so beautiful and peaceful .
The sitting was nice like an adult dog &apos; , said Oleg .
But where do I put those eight cudgels on my head ?
I would have been expelled by a woman , along with her dogs .
We still have a small child .
To take the boss &apos; , he added .
Ms Tobias , the President of Animal Asylum , confirmed that asylum was indeed granted to 8 German sheep dogs , who are two and a half months old .
On the same day , however , the owner gave in to the cocktail family .
&apos;We did not even install these images and gave them them back in the same way &apos; , he stated .
&apos;The owner of the dog was not very annoyed , but he said that they had the only place of sight and that the bus driver could have asked whether the images belong to them &apos; , said Tobias .
However , the asylum-manager added that , at the same time , it is good that the bus driver drowned the river basins on the road and did not happen to this end .
In fact , it was very good from the bus driver that he reacted .
The landscape has met where , if necessary , traditional vehicles simply cannot get off the hook with the best will .
That is where the ATV will be the solution .
The ATV , which is used in the military field , gave an overview of the taste home !
There is nothing new in the military use of such vehicles with lightweight and good penetration capacity .
The need for them arose even during the Second World War , but more attention began to be paid to them a decade later .
Simplicity and strength
As far back as 1956 , M-274 , which was known as the M-274 methodical Overland plant , had developed further development from a vehicle designed to evacuate the vulnerable in the final years of the Second World War .
For the way forward , it is a little strange to say a little bit strange to spell out the mechauvinist mule .
A more permeable vehicle is hard to imagine .
A wheelchairs platform , a job and a rot : Everything , all of the luxury .
As soon as superfluous constructors had rushed the lines too hastily off the desk and started production quickly .
However , in a war , what counts is much more permeable than comfort .
There was no opposition to the sludge put to the test in this category in the Vietnamese jungle .
It was a little easy to escape , less than a hundred kilogram machine , to paint them in places where the Willyse Yep , who met with his super-digitisation capacity , was supposed to display the brake .
Vehicles with almost 500 kilos of power were used for transport purposes , both poppy and mercury .
At times , lighter , unsettling anti-tank weapons were also fitted with the other side .
However , such a truck came down , and that still happened , it was possible for the driver to shift the rooling system forward in the latest trouble and get it so far down that it was possible to drive the vehicle in the thin blocks .
The units were produced until 1970 , totalling 11 240 , and were woefully used up until 1980 , as a result of a race against the HMWs .
In the next two decades , the ATR had a rather marginal meaning in military circles .
They came back to the picture after they fell in New York , and US soldiers found themselves buried in the desert landscape of Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was there that the knowledge and the idea that what was needed was something that would bridge the gap between the Humwee and the anti-personnel force .
Since ATVs do not generally offer considerable protection , they are not exactly the best option for directly tackling the challenges .
What is more , fast and light-touch machines are suitable for carrying out specific tasks .
For example , in reconnaissance and rescue operations .
Today , the American army uses thousands of ATVs and UTVs .
Most of them , like the XUV550s buried in the defence union , are basically identical to those in the civil turnover but supplemented in accordance with the needs of the army .
The comments received by the Kawasaze company will be represented by names such as the Kawasakle Mule , Hondt and Foreman , Yamahka Rhino and Arctic Ca , and the ever-increasing choice of the leading military producer of ATVs &apos; Polaris models .
In 2013 , the Polari concluded a five-year agreement with the American Special Force Centre ( SOCOM ) for supplying the twin MRZR2 and MRRRRR4 , and provided for a separate five-year contract for M850s made by the Polaris Sportsman base , which has both rapeppic and black-valry , and provides for innovative urban mobility . We can also after the taboo of 50 calibre weapons .
Before entering the MV850 market , MV700 and MV800 from the Polar military reached their supply .
In the case of MV700 , there is a military version of the Polaris 700c Twin Sportsman , which has been included and wanted by vines , a two-part fuel tank for major distances , a reinforced iron and north , and some more military equipment not to provide any more for farmers or cousins in the same forest .
In the same way as John Deere M-Gostators , who has been successfully used in Iraq and in Afghanistan , are equipped with armed strengths , baggage stores and some other elements that are useless in ranking shocks but necessary in the battle zone .
A vehicle weighing 750 kg can bear almost the weight of its body , in other words , 570 kg .
Engine capacity will also be enough to carry out lighter after-cuts and mega-slipped parts .
The changing vision of the back part , which is to be removed , will make it possible to drive the baggage of A to B , which is quantified by the little but whim of the insects .
Later on , A1 , supplemented by M-Gindi , was prepared by 20 horses more than the original 20-strike M-Gator , and the subsequent strengthened framework A2 , which is even better for managing and pumping , and A3 , which combines A1 and A2 &apos;s positive properties .
The fire brigades actually received in Bosnia as long ago as 1997 and 1998 , where medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded .
At the same time , they also reduced the burden on their own mobile soldiers by carrying a degree that otherwise the peat would have had to pay .
If the majority of the ATVs used in the power structures are modalities for vehicles used in civil consumption , there are also a few exceptions .
The most outstanding of these are the warfare bearing the name of Phoenix International , Prowler , which has been successfully used throughout the world for all kinds of battle- , intelligence and rescue missions .
According to the manufacturer , for the first time , 10 years ago , bottlenecks have been reported for the vehicles that have been set up to carry out specific operations , typical of the ATVs that are used and also of those modelled for the army , both for manager , resistance and for safety .
Being similar to normal ATVs from construction and beyond generation , Prowler is brutally different in terms of both his construction and his capacity .
It is quicker , more durable , more stable and able both to drag on and bear greater difficulties than other , similar vehicles .
For example , if , in the case of the ordinary ATV , the driver constantly has to play with his body in order to maintain the vehicle balance and use both hands to manoeuvre , to speed up and to put a brake on both hands , the management of the Prowler is more like driving a car .
However , in the end , it makes no difference whether the concept and use of Prowler , Gator , MV850 or another ATV - all of them have the same characteristics .
And it is clear that , in the circumstances in which defence expenditure is being sought to be reduced broadly and the smaller , fugitive , targeted and light-duty light-duty vehicles are being practised instead of broader conventional wars , it is an army that is light-weight and quick to remain in the service .
&apos;My &apos;clock died , but I did not &apos; maintain a huge smile in the Ironman 70.3 finishing .
It is true that , in the course of a whole half-long trialogue , the pound on the Raivot did not shy away .
What is more , he had 21.1 kilometres running into the conversation bet : &apos; I spoke to a man during a drink , a man walked away and wondered : &apos; Issand , you were still talking &apos; .
At the dog distance Raivo , who had had had the energy converted to drink , went a few times to walk fast .
At Treenen &apos;s suggestion .
&apos;AALAR Juhanson said that there is no point in forcing drinks , because there are such increases here and there is little point in time about whether drinks or motorway walks , &apos; the actor says that he heeded the words of the advisor .
He was also able to catch his breath at the walking times , and so after crossing the finishing line , he was also able to share unbreathed left and right interviews .
As if there were no 1.9 kilometres of swimming , 90 kilometres of motoring and 21.1 kilometres of drink behind us .
&apos;If I think my training is also to be able to enjoy this competition &apos; , admit that in January , the bookings have started and are now embedded in 16 kg &apos;s discontented slums with the loss of Raivo .
And , as far as interviews are concerned , that was my wish for me to be able to give an interview after the finishing .
I have been able to give interviews following every competition , and I had hoped that it would be nice to go on with OtemnÃ¤ Ironman as well .
I thought that it would be all very well if I was not on the west bag after Ironman ; contrary to the beating patchwork of the west bathine , Raivo finichmark offered a completely different picture : &apos; Two finishing the sky &apos; and moulding a sincere joy &apos; .
There was reason to do so : Raivol took 46 minutes for 1.9 kilometres and 24 seconds , 90 kilometres for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21.1 minutes for running a kilometre of 2 hours and 18 minutes .
&apos;My heart has now been given to the Triaton &apos; , and Raivo , who was already in the final boom , is confirming that he had given a finger to sport , and that took the finger at the taxi .
I have already registered myself behind the Tallinst Fondo of 20 August - 230 kilometres behind the Tallinst Tohpse !
So , again tomorrow , I have to keep up my momentum !
The third festival day of the Weber will be sent by a strong wind .
In this way , one of the woes who tries to fly from Turin to the captain was thrown in the eye by the acid light .
In the future , many of the festivals say that you and your eyes are full in the sand .
I think we have gone quite well .
We have done a good job of work and work &apos; , Mr Shuman man , the Putt police leader , will say how they have had the referee of the first two days of night .
He says that , even today , there are patrols police and rapid reaction in the streets and also communicating with people - that is to say , they have questions and they also want to know how to get a rapid reaction .
In two days , the police have had to deal with some battles and also drug cases .
&apos;there have also been some drug handling of a large amount of narcotic substances , but summaries when Wekun is over &apos; , Sman says .
About a hundred people have gone through the Put police station in two nights .
Fortunately , the police have not had to resolve the extremes .
By the way , Shuman being says that if you have to hate from the sky drastically and horizontally , there is not much work for them .
A head of the Iranian police has once said that rainfall is like extra staff .
The waiter police have also provided , in the Weemeal area , with staple help , where the things that have been found can be brought to and where the missing things can be called .
By the way , the police even lost one of the things they needed , whose good people had invented .
Look at the video that Andres Shuman heiki still spoke about .
The Weber festival Balticu boss Gunnar Vies talks to a fire that the festival first obtained Finland years ago and its owners went to watch the coast under the Riia for enlargement , while the shelter was stopped in PÃ¤nus and sold in Estonia on the festival of such a festival .
Gunnar says that they have committed 25 000 visitors a day , but the chickens are only counted when the festival ends .
The preparation for today &apos;s celebration has already begun in September .
&apos;We had the information by cities that last site starts construction , there is a hotel &apos; , Gunnar is talking about the change that she had to face this year .
There is no Koppa at the moment , but it is my belief that if the KOPP did not go this May , the next thing will be .
So perhaps as a woman we should have relocated somewhere &apos; , he explains why festival has moved this year .
The organisation of the Festival is going to be around for a year .
People are working in the Weew between a thousand and a half thousand - police officers , management team , volunteers , traders , security teams and so on .
The most difficult thing to do , according to Vienna , was to have the duo The Chainsmokis .
After all , men are now an undisputed figure in the poppy world .
Why it was difficult for Hhe Chainsmokers to have a Weber and how Gunnar comments on the fact that two artists cancelled their representations are already looking at video .
The snapshot in Estonia is coming from the West .
In North Estonia , there have already been voices of noise on several sides and individual concessions .
This afternoon , the nod service also issued a warning .
Today , it is mainly in North Estonia that there are several hives .
The pictures are moving quickly from the West to the east .
&apos;Nuclear-winds in the inner land amount to 15 , islands and 18 m / s , but the sun may come from stronger winds &apos; , is standing on the website of the weather service .
However , a much bigger thermal storm is raging in the south-east of Finland and Russia from St Petersburg to the east .
Fortunately , however , the wind is blowing from the West and the East in Estonia , so there is no risk , at least for the time being , of more storms turning to Estonia .
The Finns organised a dance gun for their men .
When the first male boys were held in Rakalis 11 years ago , the organisers probably did not forget that the northern neighbours were leading by the small Estonian city .
Today , however , in the west of Finland , the first Finnish male dance plant is being held in Lapua .
&apos;The representatives of the town of Lapua were so enthusiastic about the masters in the last twinning city of Rakales that they wanted to do something similar themselves &apos; , reported by Rakver &apos;s abilinnate head , Kair Pihlak .
&apos;That is what is happening today in Finland on the Lapua washing machine at the Finnish 100 celebrations , Mies-Tanssipido , where there is also 100 men from Viruland &apos; , St Pihlak said .
As Pihlet says , this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two twinning cities .
It also marks the years of the Jewish Republic of Estonia and Finland .
There is also a missile among the Standing man of 69 survivors of the upper and previous season at Karl Reinkubla .
&apos;If I have the honour of being one of the hundred men who , with their participation in Finland , show what Vicu men are able to do &apos; , he said .
&apos;Racevere dancing men have all set out their own excessive working order in the preparation of the Finnish men to show a decent level for the northern neighbours &apos; , and Ain Skarmine , a member of the Racver City Government , also commented on the undertaking .
As a whole , the presentation of the men from Virucountry has put the dance pillar TarvanpÃ¤ki , the artistic leader , on Tibet , together with the well-known compatriot , Elo Reeoja .
Estonians are based on a front-load scheme .
The first Estonian male dance plant was organised in 2006 , while the latter was in Rakalis in 2015 .
Although the media &apos;s attention has mainly been focused on the Holy Father and the Weber going on there , this is not the only music factory in this weekend .
The Incikermy festival , which is taking place in the beer region , also has loyal fans .
One of them writes , for example , in Twitter : &apos; I sold the Weemeal ticket so that I can go to Inciret &apos; .
And why not .
In addition to the domestic artists , there are also speakers from America , Finland , Lithuania , Hungary , England and elsewhere .
The festival organized in the world forest also surprises the doctors there due to the location of the magic wand .
One of them today , Lucas Rose , could not wonder how beautiful Estonia is in Twitter .
But visitors , too , have not been narrow in the distribution of intermediate admissions .
In order to be able to take part in the campaign for Incikermy festival , look at the galleries too !
Although this is over the weekend , your practice has not subsided .
There is still a handful of work , and you are also trying to urge other people to act fast .
Concerns could be forgotten and a more expensive exit vehicle could be seized .
Take the time for yourself to enjoy one another &apos;s company in a flourishing , romantic place .
Speaking on the subject of war , you have to burn your way , you have big plans , or you will forgive promises ... which a moment later you have thought of .
The other party , however , recalls your words .
It is perhaps a bit unsettling to be a guest , and it is difficult to focus on any action .
Your sense of self-esteem may not be dependent on what is happening now , but on what has happened in the past .
Also , if you get into a difficult situation , you could act quickly and prudently .
You may be helping someone out of the woe today , because you have enough wisdom and determination .
Rather , it leaves concern for monetary and business affairs .
It takes time to rest and relax .
Dealing with a Popular cause may be tireless and may be nervous .
It is possible that this has accidentally turned into a serious dispute in which you have to defend your views forcefully .
If others go across the border , then you can go down that road .
Let us be better known in the normal environment , doing things that you know and that offer joy .
You are probably not bowing to new knowledge and adventure .
Speculation is an activity that you will probably never be full of content .
Today , too , you are burying your company .
What is happening on the fence may not , however , be business as usual .
It may be that , despite a free day , you still have to deal with the glasses .
Or there was physical presence at home , but thought at the desk .
If you want hard accommodation , you can offer it travel .
In the middle of the adventure , you are absorbing you , you have to pull together to keep the wave and keep your balance .
Waste energy to debate money .
We will only take up this issue if the situation really requires urgent and decisive intervention .
In Indonesia , a man who stolen three composers from the mosque was burnt alive is being burnt by the Hungarian news agency MTI .

However , these arguments were decisively disproved by the police .
The oxygen reports that it did not make a statement on what happened .
The DPA , the German news agency , estimates that this step is due to the fact that the Independent have little confidence in the police and the judicial authorities .

The man was held hostage by a modelle plan to sell him down on the web .
In Italy , a Polish citizen took the British motto hostage .
The plan was for a 20-year-old woman to place an online ferry on the Internet , in other words , encrushed to auction , was reported by Guardian .
The police reported that a woman was lured to Milan on 11 July with a promise that she would get a photograph .
Instead , he was stunned and brought to light near Turin .
It was claimed that imprisoned women tried to sell their women on a dark web for GBP 230 000 , and submitted a ransom procurement demand to his modelling agency .
However , he was put in prison by a woman on 17 July by a British consulate .
According to the police , the Polish citizen , Lukuz Herba , is in doubt , who lives in Britain .
According to the newspaper Corriere della Sera , the man found that a abducted woman had a small child and did not want to sell him as sex slaves .
The results of the prophematics of the department revealed the delicate data of vulnerable children of negligible vessels .
As a result of a worrying breach of information , personal data on neglected children , including information about whether they are sexually active , has been mistakenly sent to one child &apos;s mother .
A table with e-mail containing the names of all children in the care of a large service provider in the town of Victoria , birthday , location and related specific concerns and attendant places was sent to his mother .
The e-mail revealed the place of life of every child .
The list points out that a 13-year-old boy is exempt from bail and sexual behaviour manifests that a 15-year-old girl with problems of self-injury , abuse of certain substances and drainage is &apos; without boy friend &apos; and &apos; no smiles tonight &apos; and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with his or her care and is verbal and aggressive .
The table appears to be a transfer document designed to send an observer in the night exchange .
The document contains notes as to when some children can wait home or whether they can contact the staff in order to catch up .
There are worryingly many details of some children .
With regard to the 15-year-old boy , it is written with warning : &apos; If the staff are in contact to obtain permission to examine the dog and / or the laptops / USB for revision because of the suspicion of unsuitable sexual material , this authorisation must be granted &apos; .
The document also states that a 17-year girl who gets 18 in just three months &apos; time and is being freed from a welfare institution is in danger of being subjected to suicide tests of such magnitude that the staff will have to call on the emergency when he is fleeing immediately .
For a 16-year-old boy who was released , it was noted that he was out and &apos; later contacted the staff in order to catch up &apos; .
Although , in the case of the places listed , only the name of a accommodation unit where children are held and not their address is mentioned , there are still enough details to be found .
The data sheet in 2015 came out when the mother shared with Fairfax MEDAS her experience in the health care and service ministry and child protection sector , starting with her daughter in the care four years ago .
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had received 18 and leaving the system .
The heart-breaking decision to hand his daughter before the protection of children was made after a violent incident at home , a case which is one of the more and more complaints of domestic violence brought by parents against their children .
This had worrying consequences that the mother could never have predicted ; for example , she was able to get a daughter six months after leaving her house after leaving seven criminal charges , she was relocated to hundreds of kilometres away into a house and an environment where she seemed to be able to survive successfully , and then she was returned without informing her parents , accepting and facilitating her daughter care for her twin relationship between her mother and her two daughters .
The relationship with the first of those boy friends , with the age of 17 , with whom a woman was regularly allowed at that time at a 15-year daughter in a local hotel , ended when a young man was presented a few days after the age of 18 because of that relationship was accused of taking a child into sexual relations .
&apos;Why did he leave the system in a worse situation when he went into it ? &apos; Ask the mother .
&apos;and will this happen to all careless children ? &apos;
He is very much in favour of setting up an institution which will allow children to be traced in the first few weeks at the health and service ministry before they are relocated to their homes .
This would enable them to understand better how children interact with others and what the dangers and needs are associated with them , particularly in educational terms .
The government of the state is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in their home welfare by seeking , among other things , to better support their parents .
With a clear guideline line for assistance packages financed over four years with USD 62 million , the aim is to help transmit children into situations of better organisation than care at home .
In addition , the EUR 5.6 million two-year experiment , which was published last October , will enable professional carers to be provided to at least 28 children to help them get out of care or to avoid them coming into it .
According to the department spokesman , the information leak was not officially reported when it happened , although the mother claims that two departmental workers were informed within a few months of the incident .
A department is now working with a service provider to analyse the case .
&apos;every leak of alleged private data is taken very seriously and we will work to ensure that it has not had a negative impact on the young people concerned &apos; .
In July last year , the Minister for Families and Children , Jenny Mikakos , ordered an independent review of the incident on the privacy of child protection during a five-year period .
The department agreed with seven recommendations as a result and has subsequently updated the Code of Protection for Children to ensure that the staff clearly understand their roles and privacy procedures , changed IT systems to ban the automatic concentration of certain personal data , and formally examined the services related to the privacy of the department .

Vietnam &apos; regrets &apos; Germany &apos;s accusation of kidnapping .
Vietnam said on Thursday that he regrets the comments made by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs accusing the Vietnamese intelligence service of the kidnapping of a former Vietnamese oil trader , who is recovered because of accusations at home .
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was taken along from Berlin , which left Vietnam &apos;s axles on Wednesday 48 hours to leave the country .
Thanh faces acquiescence charges with the death penalty in the event of a conviction .
He sought asylum from Germany , but his statement had not yet been worked through when the Vietnamese authorities called for his extradition .
The representative of the Vietnamese Foreign Minister , Le Thi Thu Hang , said to reporters that these comments were &apos; extremely regrettable &apos; and that Thanh gave himself to the police in Vietnam on 31 July .
&apos;Vietnam always sets great store by and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany &apos; , he said without going into detail .
Thanh , 51 , disappeared last July after it was initially charged with dishonest management at the National Han and Gay tyre of PetroVietnam , which caused losses of around USD 150 million .
The Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September .
In March , the police initiated an investigation into the emancipation of his alleged involvement in the property project .
Thanh was the Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013 , when he was appointed to the government for several senior posts , including Deputy Chairman of the province of Hau Giang delta in the south .
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016 , but was released from a legislative body dominated by the Communists before the first month of the session .
He was also expelled from the Communist Party .
The Vietnamese Ambassador in Germany was invited on Tuesday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him that Germany was calling for Thanh to be returned so that asylum and extradition procedures can be implemented correctly .
The results of the investigation show that printer material is also spreading seeds .
Printer seeds are also spreading like births and mammals .
These insects are known mainly as lagundagoers helping to demolish substances that are recovered from the forest .
The Iraqis are also helping to disperse the seeds .
Japanese scientists discovered that printed carrots have an important role to play in the distribution of seeds at Monotropastrum , the wild wild monotropastrum .
It is an unusual plant .
It does not include a chlorine , so it is not capable of photosynthesis .
Instead , the species will receive its nutrient mixtures grown beneath its surface .
Taim pods small fragrances and potatoes on forest grounds .
Viljail has very little or no taste , and Japanese researchers found that poultry and mammals are not interested in them as a source of food .
Only a handful of spineless consumption of fruit and forest printed Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited fruit .
Investigators looked at the issue of printer drowning in order to ascertain whether these insects help spread seeds .
Scientists found that an average of three soaps were found to be fed every grain after they had been fed .
Further tests confirmed that the majority of seed seed was viable .
Scientists assume that this unique plant elite has probably learned to make use of the ability to spread printed seeds during evolution .
We acquire the skills close to the ground and they will be ready at the same time as the prinklers get out of their vassals .
Investigators published their findings in the Botanica Journal of the Linnean Society this week .
&apos;Given that around 4 600 printed rooms have been identified so far , the distribution of seeds through printed rains may be much more extensive , and so far just an undocumented mechanism , not just the unique ability of a particular plant block to exploit printed princs &apos; , said in a press release including Professor of the University of Naoto Sugiura , Kumamoto .
&apos;It is hoped that public bread will encourage people to pay more attention to inter-plant and printed relationships and to look for further examples of how printed seeds spread &apos; .
The Flyso-called report on the disclosure of improved information , which shows additional payments .
Michael Flyso-called , who served for a short time as an adviser on national security , submitted on Thursday a report on the disclosure of improved federal financial information containing new details of Flynn &apos;s transfer of trumps to presidential office , an Iraq-American businessman and a fact-of-the-euro campaign with the parent company .
In a letter which sent information with improvements , Flyso-called stated that his initial information disclosure reports were submitted under fast-tracked conditions without the usual consultation and supervision provided by the Valge Maand lawyers and the government &apos;s ethical office .
According to the letter , the Flyso-called &apos; part &apos; did not receive the attention given to others , as he was no longer a worker from the White House at the time .
Flyso-called relinquished his post just 24 days after taking office in the middle of rumours that he had given misleading information to Vice-President Pence about his post-election ties with the Russian Ambassador in the United States .
Flyso-called also attracted criticism for cross-border payments during work in the private sector following the dismissal of the Director of the Defence Agency in 2014 .
In an information provided previously by investigators in the House of Deputies , Flyso-called declared that , in 2015 , around USD 68 000 were paid and paid by entities linked to Russia .
In addition to the income related to Russia , the information on Thursday revealed that Flyso-called had received at least USD 5 000 for a consultancy service for a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East .
The Flynn work on the project was published earlier , but it was not known that he was paid for it .
The renewed information also confirms that the Flyso-called had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at that time with the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica - that is , the Donald trumpi campaign .
Cambridge Department , one of the main donors of hedge funds , Robert L. mercher , whose daughter Rebekah is an influential Conservative financial supporter .
Washington Post announced in February that the Flyso-called salary was the SCL Group advisor .
According to those who know his role , Flynn &apos;s aim was to help the US subsidiary to win new public contracts with the United States .
At the same time , the head of the efforts to conclude public contracts was asked by the government of a former colleague from Flynn from the government of a national poem .
Flyso-called said that the person who is familiar with his activities did not receive any compensation or real work from the SCLs .
The new information revealed that Flyah had received a trump card in connection with the Presidential transfer of around USD 28 000 .
The largest source of public revenue is 140 000 dollars from Flynn &apos;s work as an adviser and consultant from NJK Holding corpus in Minsk , led by Nasser Kazeminy , a businessman born in Iran and now living in the United States .
The press reported on Thursday evening on a statement by the NJK which &apos; consulted Flyso-called NK Holdings on the interest in investing in the securities of the company &apos; .
The NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systeml , whose Vice-Chairman is Flyso-called .
Mr Kian , a business partner of Flyso-called Intel , Mr GreenZone , is being led by Mr Bijan , a company that is currently lobbying on behalf of a Dutch company that is linked to the Turkish Government because of its role .
On Thursday in the past , Elijah E. Cumda ( Md ) , a leading democrat in the monitoring and government reform committees of the House of Representatives , asked Kiani to provide information on foreign business contacts and journeys from Flynn .
During the previous security check in Flynn , Kian told military researchers that his partner had many foreign commercial contact .
According to CUMINGS , the Flyos said nothing about such contacts .
According to a person who is familiar with the situation , Flyso-called was nevertheless subject to security checks at the time .
