is there finally a solution to avoid te@@ di@@ ous ro@@ by speeches ?
for Mr R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , answering the phone is often a waste of time .
his S@@ port City Pi@@ z@@ za P@@ u@@ b , based in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ os in New York , is dependent on cli@@ ents ring up and outs@@ our@@ cing can@@ c@@ ers , pi@@ z@@ za and po@@ ta@@ to@@ es .
but , for a large part of the time , these are automatic messages that try to get fraud through .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen it is coming to the point that it does not allow the other stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists to get us in &apos; , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old ba@@ r ow@@ ner said .
aid is on the way , albeit slowly .
over the past year , at government inspired by the mobile phones , new tools have been added to countera@@ ct un@@ wanted &apos; ro@@ b@@ ot@@ ted &apos; calls .
the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al Commun@@ ic@@ ations Com@@ mis@@ si@@ on has proposed enabling telephone companies to block j@@ un@@ k calls more and hopes to def@@ use peti@@ tion@@ ers with high fines .
according to the experts , these steps are not a final solution , but they are a good start .
f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist and shareholders should protect people from un@@ wanted calls from distance distributors .
however , the fra@@ ud@@ sters are not interested in breaking the law .
fra@@ ud@@ sters reach people cheap@@ ly and easily using &apos; automatic voters &apos; , which automatically make more speeches at the same time .
it is estimated that the Americans receive tens of millions of Rom@@ ans a day .
all of them , of course , are not fraudulent .
pharma@@ cies send out , for example , automa@@ ted messages about compliance with prescri@@ ptions .
however , all too often the situation is as follows : be in debt to the tax authorities ; Mic@@ ro@@ soft calls to order a computer for free c@@ rus@@ a@@ des !
in addition , j@@ un@@ k bro@@ kers use complex technology , which shows a local or important number on their te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y , such as the tax office .
implementing appropriate measures for &apos; s@@ wind@@ le numbers &apos; would aggra@@ vate fraud and help US consumers to save millions of dollars , as stated in the document by the Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor Group of State In@@ te@@ rests .
telephone companies and independent applications are able to drive or block un@@ wanted speeches in comparison to known problem numbers and analyse dubious behaviour , such as the number , which calls for many people in non-@@ call lists .
management free service providers also have a tool to add warnings to in@@ coming speeches such as &apos; possibly fraudulent &apos; , but they are not available on all te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y and on many customers with paid cards .
they can be ordered by V@@ eri@@ z@@ on and S@@ prin@@ ter for a su@@ per levy .
some And@@ ro@@ id@@ -@@ te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es , including Google i Pi@@ x@@ el , travel j@@ un@@ k calls free of charge .
J@@ en V@@ ar@@ gas ( 39 ) media producer from Or@@ gan@@ os F@@ l@@ or@@ da said that his A@@ T application would mark and block certain fraudulent speeches on his mobile phone , but he has given up his mobile phone .
&apos;@@ very rarely do I take speeches from figures that I do not know &apos; said in War@@ gas .
applications such as Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il and N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o offer free , but limited , relief for domestic phones .
in the case of Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il , the operator must allow &apos; conditional conver@@ sion &apos; , which will drive the speeches forward if the line is not answered or occupied .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available for all service providers in the home and does not work with parents , c@@ olu@@ m@@ -based te@@ lep@@ hon@@ es .
it is also possible to buy references , some of which are quite abun@@ dan@@ tly s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated , which block calls on domestic phones .
V@@ eri@@ z@@ on is also test of dubious calls for warnings to be displayed on domestic phones .
telephone companies can already block certain speeches that are fraudulent .
the Fle@@ c has proposed rules to form@@ alise such practices and allow other speeches suspected of fraud to be blocked .
this means that V@@ eri@@ z@@ on can block a du@@ ty@@ -free number that accommo@@ date calls for payment but never starts a single figure on its own .
operators would also be able to block speeches where they know that they are not legitimate , for example , with 9@@ 11 guide@@ line numbers .
these rules need further elabor@@ ation .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , a public poli@@ cing officer in a non-@@ prof@@ it@@ -@@ making consumer union , said that these developments were &apos; encouraging &apos; but do not protect consumers from all un@@ wanted calls .
firstly , non-EU lists do not apply to certain types of phone char@@ gers , such as creditors and political campaigns .
in addition , according to Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , only falsified figures would be covered .
not all the ro@@ ckets are intended to be s@@ wind@@ led .
the consumer union wants telephone companies to make available to all consumers free of charge , in order to block calls .
in the long term , the Fle@@ c industry supports attempts to affir@@ m that it is indeed the cal@@ ler who claims to be the one he claims to be .
perhaps one day it will be possible to see a green light on the scre@@ en on the scre@@ en if the cal@@ ler is legitimate .
the lobby of the tele@@ com companies , U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tele@@ com , says that it could take several years to introduce it , but that would be a powerful tool against ro@@ bo@@ ilers .
F@@ c@@ c is also looking at ways to end the succes@@ sion of te@@ di@@ ous speeches to consumers who change the number .
if you register at the moment on the &apos; no-@@ call &apos; list , but obtain a new number for yourself later on , you may not know it and may not b@@ other on the new line .
&apos;@@ R@@ ob@@ o@@ th@@ el@@ ers are not going to disappear &apos; , A@@ ar@@ on F@@ os@@ s N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bo@@ st , a service for blocking calls for mobile phones and domestic phones .
&apos;@@ The@@ y are criminal and find a new way of by@@ passing any system .
however , it is our job to make it as difficult as possible for them &apos; .
there are a number of logical measures that consumers should implement .
do not answer the phone if you do not know the numbers .
yes , this is unfortunately not practical for business calls like S@@ port City .
cut off the un@@ wanted speeches .
do not speak up and press no bu@@ tton .
when you engage with them , they can mention you with a gentle@@ man who will react and bur@@ y you with more speeches .
if possible , block the number after the speech .
use the applications to block speeches .
if you have concerns about privacy , check the application rules to see whether it shares your account or contact data with distributors .
do not put personal data on the phone char@@ gers , such as a bank account or a social security number .
the Nor@@ de@@ a and D@@ N@@ B combined bank will become a reality by the end of the year .
the accession of the financial grou@@ p@@ ings bearing the name of D@@ N@@ B and Nor@@ de@@ a , Lu@@ min@@ or@@ i , will only happen in the last quarter of this year , will be written by Tuesday .
the opening of the common legal body has been delayed and delayed .
following the publication of the accession plans in the summer , the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter .
in April , however , the D@@ N@@ B communication man@@ ager said that it was delayed in the third quarter .
indeed , the Swedish financial inspe@@ c@@ torate , Lu@@ min@@ or , given the regional importance of the International Bank , gave additional guidance to fulfil .
Russia &apos;s railways are looking into the possibility of getting the S@@ t bu@@ ri@@ -@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ Berlin travelling train off the road .
Russia &apos;s railways are stu@@ dying the possibility of getting the Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Peter@@ s@@ burg train via Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad , who was reported to Vik@@ tor G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in Inter@@ fa@@ x Se@@ ve@@ ro-@@ Z@@ a@@ pa@@ d , the Director@@ -General of the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad railway .
the monitor for travel travel is about the fact that , from an economic point of view , it is hardly possible to put the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad - Berlin trains on the table again .
and we are offering a second route - Ber@@ li@@ in-@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d@@ -@@ Peter@@ s@@ burg .
the technical means to do this exist , both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of rolling stock &apos; , Mr G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in said .
addi@@ tionally , G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in stated that there are already Russian trains that can replace the ra@@ da@@ r and continue to travel on the European track basin .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in believes that this is the direction in the long term , because at the moment , the inhabitants of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg and the entire nor@@ th-@@ west of Russia are having to travel to Germany via Moscow and B@@ rest@@ i .
as a possible option , Latvia will be discussed along the route through Latvia , the Latvian Del@@ ft ( L@@ at@@ vi@@ ja D@@ z@@ el@@ z@@ el@@ z@@ ella ) was approved by a press spokes@@ man in M@@ â@@ ri@@ r O@@ z@@ ol@@ s , who said that there is no specific decision at the moment , but the option is under discussion .
the Latvian railway , together with its partners , including the Russian railways , is looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in passenger flow services so that rail transport can compete with road transport .
the Chinese company , which came to Estonia , immediately ordered EUR 100 million .
the Chinese ow@@ ner of agricultural produce , A@@ g@@ ri@@ tera , which only began operations last year , has reached almost EUR 100 million .
a profit of nearly EUR 2 million is written by Tuesday .
according to the company &apos;s annual report , sales revenue from agricultural output combined with whole@@ sale A@@ g@@ ri@@ tera will reach EUR 10@@ 0.@@ 6 million in 201@@ 6 .
the profits were made at EUR 1.@@ 91 million .
a year earlier , there was no economic activity at the company .
the company had an average population of 3 people , and in 2015 there were no workers .
the turnover per worker amoun@@ ted to EUR 3@@ 3.@@ 6 million , with an average gross income of EUR 3@@ 16 per month .

many Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans already have , without their knowledge , a Thursday working week .
however , not as they are waiting to write Tuesday .
it has been created by modern work space planning , in other words , an open office .
in the office without Se@@ in@@ te@@ ta , a pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous management ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine H@@ ar@@ m@@ ard Business Re@@ vi@@ e@@ w provides workers with almost 1.5 hours a day , that is to say , almost an entire working day a week .
however , if the working week of Thursday is considered as four working days and three rest days , then such a forced solution will be worse than that .
one and a half hours of working time have been concentrated with the family and with difficulty of focusing instead of ho@@ b@@ bies or was@@ teful recovery , disruption of work , rising irri@@ tation and anxi@@ ety , and a loss of work will .
how do we finance company vehicles ?
there has been a change in the consumer society in terms of financing the vehicles of the enlarged companies - with more and more companies taking full service or , on the contrary , a fre@@ er , long-@@ stay car .
the le@@ asing and le@@ asing of a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions , which include multiple obligations and expectations , but which often lead to confusion .
according to the opinion of the international author &apos;s company , the Est@@ onian Pro@@ duc@@ tion and Market Govern@@ or , Vil@@ li T@@ a@@ id@@ is , we can see that companies are moving more and more towards full service and that long-term le@@ ase opportunities are increasingly being used .
the plant pointed out the main issues to which , when looking for answers , it will be possible to choose the way in which the vehicle is used for itself .
how long can you use the vehicle ?
the biggest difference in car ren@@ ting and le@@ asing is the time for use .
&apos;@@ Li@@ ving is worth prefer@@ ring to long@@ er@@ -term vehicle necessity if a company has plans to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period &apos; , explained by the TV , adding that it is worth deciding in favour of a plant if it is to have a vehicle , to have a full-@@ time service , to have a long-term drive , if it is to use a vehicle as a service or to use a car on a daily basis , but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and to give up ownership .
&apos;@@ The car of R@@ endi@@ car has a much shorter use period than the li@@ ter@@ ary period , but many major car ren@@ tal companies also provide a long-term author@@ ita@@ tive , with car ren@@ tal without complex contracts and free re@@ fund &apos; , presented different ways of le@@ asing a car .
who will become the ow@@ ner of the vehicle ?
at the end of the publication , the ow@@ ner of the ren@@ tal car becomes the ow@@ ner of the car .
&apos;@@ in the case of full service , at the end of the fa@@ ci@@ li@@ tation period , it will be possible to carry on with the li@@ g@@ ni@@ te payment under the same or better conditions , with a new vehicle equivalent to the needs of the company &apos; , he said , emphasising that , as the consumer society is moving increasingly towards the average consumption of services , ow@@ ning a vehicle is an additional responsibility for the company .
in addition , when it comes to full service travel , there is also an opportunity to buy a car for itself on the basis of a desire and agreed conditions .
however , there is no le@@ ase available and only the use period is paid .
the cop@@ ying of a car is generally carried out in the offices of car firms , and the rent of a car is lea@@ sed out from the temporary con@@ vo@@ y of the ren@@ tal companies .
the oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions of car companies , in particular , deal with the sale of vehicles , but also offer the possibility of flying and , in some cases , of the author .
on the other hand , train companies have cars with the sole aim of le@@ asing them out .
the gold said that the reasons for using the ren@@ tal service are different - many companies are le@@ asing their vehicles , and in addition the service is convenient in being com@@ man@@ ded or on holiday , or if one &apos;s own car is improved .
&apos;@@ In the case of commercial vehicles , more and more are swit@@ ched over to full service travel , providing customers with transparency of costs , time savings in the process of buying , uti@@ lis@@ ing and rec@@ ou@@ ping vehicles , and more comfor@@ t &apos; , introduced a growing trend of attra@@ ction by the sales and marketing driver .
every year more and more companies use full services for their fleets , thereby optimis@@ ing their spending and focusing on their basic business .
what is service based insurance coverage ?
if there is a mandatory c@@ at and motor insurance for a li@@ te@@ rate car , the ren@@ tal car is mostly covered by basic insurance and , in addition , it has to be decided whether to include emergency insurance , property insurance or full insurance , for example : &apos; if you compare sales with full service travel , the custom@@ er receives an equivalent monthly payment at a higher rate , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , car clo@@ th@@ es also cover cover the scheduled monthly payment . ty@@ re exchanges and other agreed services &apos; , explained by the gold .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen it is possible to take any new vehicle into a plant , the full service provider helps choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company , which also takes into account the functions of use &apos; , he compared with emphasising that full service coverage would certainly help to opti@@ mise the costs incurred by the company in terms of car fleets .
&apos;@@ The selection of le@@ ase vehicles , however , depends on the bat@@ ch of service providers &apos; cars : different le@@ asing companies offer their vehicle fleet both a small and econom@@ ical vehicle for urban traffic and a luxury pi@@ g for business meetings &apos; .
in the bus@@ y le@@ ase period , it may , of course , be the case that the desired car is already lea@@ sed out , but boo@@ king in advance will help against it .
the choice between le@@ asing or le@@ asing should first be made clear what its objectives are - how long the desire to use a vehicle will be and what long-term plans are with regard to cars .
it is certainly also worth looking closely at the different conditions and responsibilities of services .
how a single man built a dossier worth paying his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter 51 million dollars on his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter .
a living father in T@@ ex@@ as discovered that there is no issue in which his disabled da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter could play .
he therefore decided to build one .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N had just come out of the family holiday club when his 12-@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter M@@ body approached other children playing in the water .
he tried to scre@@ en them , but they quickly left the Ba@@ sin .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N thinks they are horri@@ fied because they do not know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive view and also a form of au@@ tis@@ m .
this incident has left him in ha@@ unt .
&apos;@@ Morgan is a young gir@@ l in the mira@@ cle .
his meeting always leads to a s@@ mi@@ le of f@@ us@@ s and he certainly wants to ti@@ p .
but there have been many times when we have not been able to take him in different places &apos; he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and her hus@@ band &apos;s Mag@@ gi@@ e asked other parents where they could take their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter - somewhere he feels comfortable and others would feel comfortable with him as well .
&apos;@@ We come to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N will speak .
therefore , in 2007 he decided to build it himself .
the former property develop@@ ers sold their home farms in 2005 in order to set up The Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N F@@ am@@ il@@ y Foundation - a no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit unit that helps disabled people .
he then started the creation of the &apos; first most accessible item in the world &apos; .
&apos;@@ We wanted to set up a subject area where everyone can do everything where people with special needs and special needs can play &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he called doctors , steel be@@ ans , parents and other people with disabilities and disabilities to consult on the facility .
they were e@@ rec@@ ted in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ ex@@ as , a ten@@ -@@ hectares abandoned career .
the par@@ k called Morgan &apos; s W@@ on@@ der@@ land cost USD 34 million ( GBP 26 million ) and opened in 2010 .
the partnerships include a completely accessible view , a rand@@ om pla@@ y@@ ground and a min@@ ir@@ ong .
visitors often say to Har@@ t@@ man that it was not possible for the first time to experience these abuses .
there is also a ca@@ rou@@ sel which has a design translation speci@@ ally for wh@@ eel@@ chairs , which goes up and down the animals .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N recognises , however , that the Morgan was initially afraid of driving .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we opened , he did not dare to go to it .
he did not understand why it is going round and why the animals are up and down , and H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
it took three years for a Morgan to agree to go to a ca@@ rou@@ sel .
&apos;@@ First of all , he was just standing close to it , then he was going to be creative , but we did not get off the hoo@@ k .
it was a slow process , but now he likes to drive it .
overcoming anything that frigh@@ tened him meant a lot for him .
the small things that have been achieved make a big difference &apos; .
since its opening , more than a million people have visited 67 countries in Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ land and 50 of all American states .
a third of the staff are disabled and entry is free for anyone with a condition .
&apos;@@ I understood that the Morgan is one of the happy ones , because it has many of the things that it needs .
I did not want the price to be an obstacle for other people with special needs &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ L@@ et us do it every year , knowing that we will be left to the detriment of at least a million dollars ( GBP 750 000 ) , and that we will have to re@@ serve it with the help of cor@@ ps and partners &apos; .
this year , the thematic par@@ k Morgan &apos; In@@ spi@@ ra@@ ti@@ on was extended by opening Iceland , that is to say , a fully accessible water par@@ k .
&apos;@@ in July , fewer people visited a par@@ k because wh@@ eel@@ chairs became too heated .
so we decided to set up a water par@@ k &apos; , and H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N is talking .
in some parts of the island , warm water has been used , which helps visitors with meat problems .
there are water@@ tight , se@@ den@@ tary wh@@ eel@@ chairs available working with pressure and not bat@@ teri@@ es .
it is also possible to travel boats on the river .
the water par@@ k cost a total of USD 17 million ( GBP 13 million ) .
&apos;@@ yesterday a man from Iceland came to me and just kept me away &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N is speaking .
&apos;@@ he referred to his son , who has serious special needs , and began to m@@ our@@ n .
he said he had not been able to play his son in the water before &apos; .
according to Har@@ t@@ man , there are no three par@@ ks of every four visitors with disabilities , and the bat@@ ch has exactly the effect that he had hoped .
&apos;@@ This helps people to understand that , although we are different in certain ways , we are actually exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me see how a gir@@ l in a wh@@ eel@@ chairs went to another gir@@ l with no special needs and they began to play together .
it was a real com@@ pul@@ sion &apos; .
Har@@ t@@ man does not intend to open any more par@@ ks , although he has received hundreds of letters and me@@ les from people who would also like to have their own neighbourhood .
instead , it will focus in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ o on providing educational facilities for ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents with special needs .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat I know is that there are many different organisations trying to build something like M@@ body &apos; s W@@ on@@ der@@ land elsewhere , and we will continue to work with them &apos; , adding to it .
it continues to take the M@@ organ@@ i to play a role in this matter - the Morgan is now a kind of gl@@ ory .
&apos;@@ I@@ f he comes here , he is like a ro@@ ck sta@@ ar !
many people want to talk to him and get a picture with him ; he is cop@@ ing well with it &apos; , and H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
a body that is now 23 years old can do things more and better .
&apos;@@ he is now talking more , and most of his physical problems have been resolved in numerous operations .
we are so proud that he has come that far &apos; .
when a body is visiting the par@@ k , it likes to play the most a@@ x@@ les and s@@ and , without knowing how much it has helped others .
&apos;@@ Morgan knows that the par@@ k has had its name , but I do not believe that he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives &apos; , and H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
&apos;@@ he does not understand that the way he has dealt with things in his life has made him a real source of inspiration &apos; .
the call for drivers to find two girls being ra@@ ped in W@@ it@@ ton is a gir@@ l .
the police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the investigation into the rape of a 14@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l .
a teen@@ age attack was on the B@@ ir@@ ming@@ ha@@ m region of W@@ it@@ ton on 26 July around 02 : 00 ( B@@ S@@ T ) .
before that attack , he was ra@@ ped at the W@@ it@@ ton station .
in connection with the first case , an accus@@ ation has been made against a man .
the British Transport police want to speak as part of an investigation with two drivers .
according to the police , the first car &apos;s her@@ d is a colour co@@ ding .
the rese@@ ar@@ cher inspe@@ c@@ tor , T@@ ony F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , said : &apos; we have grounds to believe that the driver of the vehicle at the plant spoke of a victim before the other person pic@@ ked him and then ra@@ ped in the car .
we would like to know what was said during this conver@@ sation and , in addition , the leader may know the important details that would help us in our investigation &apos; .
the driver of another vehicle , which was described as red V@@ W S@@ har@@ an , was probably taken home by the police after being ra@@ ped for a second time .
the can@@ e G@@ en@@ i@@ e was named as &apos; G@@ en@@ i@@ e &apos; .
the ba@@ il-@@ out box , supported by its ow@@ ner in the course of a re@@ con@@ na@@ is@@ san@@ ce treatment , was declared public at a ye@@ arly box .
G@@ en@@ i@@ e was recognised because he lo@@ cked up his ow@@ ner , E@@ vi@@ e H@@ end@@ er@@ son ( 11 ) from L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n , during six chemical a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
E@@ vi@@ e was diagno@@ sed with a re@@ con@@ na@@ is@@ san@@ ce cancer in March 201@@ 6 and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e company itself said that it helped to cope with a series of painful operations and a long time spent in hospital .
the c@@ at was recognised by the ch@@ arity organisation Ca@@ ts Pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on at the ceremony in London .
photo@@ graph@@ y : according to E@@ vi@@ e , c@@ at was in support of him when he lost his long bro@@ thers because of ch@@ emis@@ try .
&apos;@@ In my view , he is the best .
it deserves that .
he has always been in place for me &apos; ; he said E@@ vi@@ e .
&apos;@@ he came to my bro@@ ther and sat next to my feet .
he then c@@ oo@@ ked a b@@ ric@@ k and ju@@ mp@@ ing a sof@@ ter to sin@@ k with his b@@ ag@@ s on my kne@@ es .
when I was too sick to be able to come in or go out , and I had to sit at home , he came to me and made me much ha@@ p@@ pi@@ er by offering great comfor@@ t &apos; .
according to E@@ vi@@ e , he has a special connection with his pet , which was of huge support to him when he lost his ha@@ ir because of his de@@ af@@ ening treatment .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at led me out very much because I had long bro@@ thers and ha@@ ir .
however , because of the mes@@ s , G@@ en@@ i@@ e was sh@@ ou@@ ting in the same b@@ reat@@ h , and because I lost my ha@@ ir and those of G@@ en@@ i@@ e , slightly miti@@ gated the whole shock &apos; .
E@@ vi@@ e father , Ch@@ ris H@@ end@@ er@@ son , said that the box had &apos; a wonderful dis@@ tra@@ ction &apos; and described how E@@ vi@@ e &apos; used to look at their bel@@ o@@ ved pet vi@@ de@@ signs in a hospital bed .
&apos;@@ E@@ vi@@ e was over 300 days in a hospital , so we spent a lot of time there , and it offered him something to expect when he got home for a few valuable days &apos; .

the group is pushing the government to agree on the Bre@@ x transitional conditions .
one of the largest groups of business lobbyists in Britain is urging the government to stop dan@@ cing around the p@@ eri@@ ph@@ ery of Bre@@ x .
the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te of Di@@ re@@ c@@ tor@@ s ( I@@ o@@ D ) called on the government to propose the &apos; transitional treaty &apos; in order to make progress with Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ s smooth .
it wants the government to create a &apos; Bre@@ x divide &apos; between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements .
the group warned that without such an agreement there would be &apos; short-term cha@@ otic fisheries volatility &apos; for business activity .
they criticised the government for &apos; engaging in any kind of speculative disputes &apos; .
in recent weeks , members of the government have voiced conflicting views on how long the transition period las@@ ts and what it brings with it .
in the I@@ o@@ D report , &apos; T@@ han@@ k@@ ling the Bre@@ x@@ s gap - options for a transition &apos; , it says : &apos; instead of bur@@ d@@ ening the problem by far , the government must re@@ open a strategic debate on this issue .
this could minimise the ever-increasing confusion and uncertainty in this area &apos; .
however , this week , Mr Ly@@ ons , the econom@@ ist and the Ex@@ con@@ om@@ is@@ ts for Bre@@ x , described concern about the &apos; expensive fluctu@@ ating &apos; Bre@@ x as the &apos; s@@ care@@ mon@@ g@@ ering &apos; story &apos; of s@@ care@@ mon@@ g@@ ering , re@@ minis@@ cent of Y@@ 2@@ K &apos;s computer error in fear of the M@@ DGs .
War@@ ak@@ an@@ ts@@ ler Phili@@ p Ham@@ mon@@ d warned in June : &apos; there is a large amount of business investment that will be delayed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is &apos; .
Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ is@@ on , I@@ o@@ D E@@ L@@ -@@ trade policy leader , said : &apos; K@@ an@@ ts@@ ler has a right to be concerned about the delays in business investment .
this is one of the most frequent changes to be dealt with in connection with Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ s , alongside the de@@ lo@@ c@@ alisation of services within the EU .
the latter applies especially to the members of Northern Ireland who are currently considering joint relocation or relocation &apos; .
I@@ o@@ D offers a number of opportunities , including the following extension of Article 50 of the agreement from March 201@@ 9 .
accession to the European Economic Area
consent to remain within the government area of EU legislation for a long time .
the creation of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU &apos;s customs union .
Ren@@ is@@ on said : &apos; I@@ o@@ D proposed these opportunities in connection with the transition , hoping that it will spar@@ k a proper debate on how best to bring Bre@@ x to a conclusion .
priorit@@ ising the interim arrangements and thereby miti@@ gating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term cha@@ otic expensive fluctu@@ ations do not dimin@@ ish future opportunities &apos; .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an species are at a cross@@ roads .
professional sport stands at a cross@@ roads in Australia : some areas have mig@@ rated by corporate means to such an extent that they are too commer@@ ci@@ ally oriented to classi@@ fy sport ;

this confusion is illustra@@ ted by the embarras@@ sing delays in reaching a wage agreement with players , by the un@@ decided dis@@ mis@@ sal of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an R@@ g@@ by Union ( ste@@ e@@ p ) team , by the stakehol@@ der up@@ rising of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an football economy ( ff@@ a ) , by striking striking too hard at putting together an independent commission to function and by Australia &apos;s football lea@@ gue ( A@@ F@@ L ) in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent attempts to be a be@@ ac@@ on social justice and a pla@@ gue among the people .
the investment ban@@ ker and the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an S@@ port Commission , John W@@ y@@ li@@ e , have attempted to ste@@ er the Olympic report on the same path as professional discipl@@ ines by placing business@@ men in the top positions with no elite experience of sport .
the mining gi@@ ant Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to , who has the reputation of using ta@@ ctic trade unions , was seen as col@@ legi@@ ate problems in reaching an agreement between A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cri@@ cket players &apos; union ( AC@@ A ) .
Mr President , Mr Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r , is the former CE@@ O of Ri@@ o tin@@ to A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia , and he has asked the CAP to help the head and advi@@ ser in the wage negotiations .
however , it would be a mistake to believe that the elite business@@ men , whose approach is ru@@ th@@ less in their dealings with criminal players , do not like this sport .
Pe@@ e@@ ve@@ r , for example , was a regular vis@@ it@@ or of the S@@ ec@@ tor &apos;s house games until he had moved to another state .
nevertheless , the tough negotiations between ca and AC@@ A and the extremely high wages have created the impression that A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an pet reference is now more business than the pre@@ valence of sport .
on the contrary , however , the team of A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ by , the former CE@@ O of the Naz@@ i , Cam@@ er@@ on C@@ l@@ y@@ ne , has pushed far too back to its roots .
the people of the R@@ ag@@ bi@@ an Union now prefer to break to the sub@@ urban sta@@ di@@ um in order to look at the game between the ama@@ te@@ ur teams , while at the same time being be@@ a@@ ten and cul@@ min@@ ating in hot do@@ g .
R@@ ag@@ bi@@ li@@ n bo@@ asts of having the most qualified and ver@@ sa@@ tile management in Australia , but failure to meet the demands of international partners shows that it is still too much sport to be a business .
there is a problem with governance , both in the ra@@ g@@ by lea@@ gue and in football , because the stakeholders demand more power .
the chair@@ men of both too much , John G@@ ran@@ t AR@@ L@@ C and Ste@@ ven L@@ ow@@ y , have shown that their commercial skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability .
G@@ ran@@ t , former K@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o , led a successful IT company , but for 20 years was completely out of the game .
it became a value when the newly formed AR@@ L@@ C needed an independent Presidency .
too stakeholders , who did not trust each other , decided that no one could participate in the work of the Commission who has participated in a ra@@ g@@ by lea@@ gue for the last three years in any way , except as a passive fan .
the p@@ ound s@@ li@@ d too far into the business side , however , and too many f@@ ans have been looking for the sa@@ vi@@ our since then - someone who has a distinguished past in sport .
CE@@ O of West@@ ph@@ ile for Foreign In@@ ves@@ t@@ ments , L@@ ow@@ y quite ff@@ a Chair of his father , Fran@@ k , A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an rich@@ est person .
the A@@ -@@ too club@@ s wish to be better represented in the P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential Congress .
their owners lose money , but believe that they are as decent as Man@@ ch@@ ester Uni@@ tes .
iron@@ ically , the channel of sporting and business ethics ex@@ pe@@ ls F@@ IF@@ A to stop the civil war in sport .
the A@@ FL@@ l has its own links with Ri@@ o T@@ in@@ to@@ s recently by President M@@ ike F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k and the former Commissioner of A@@ à , Ch@@ ris L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , mining gi@@ ant , and the financial man@@ ager .
it is all too proud to take the lead of the state in promoting gender equality , indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights .
some cy@@ n@@ ics could in@@ sin@@ u@@ ate that this is being done by government subsidies in the Bi@@ ble .
the A@@ FL@@ -@@ President , Richard Go@@ y@@ der , said when he took up the place of F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k : &apos; A@@ F@@ L is more than business , given how it helps all these communities &apos; .
Go@@ y@@ der is soon the out@@ going Executive Director of W@@ es@@ far@@ mer and the first presidency of A@@ à , who has not played the game at elite level .
the former President of W@@ es@@ far@@ mer , Bo@@ b E@@ ver@@ y , is involved in the management of C@@ ric@@ ke A@@ us@@ tr@@ alia .
the threa@@ d running through the appointment of members of professional sports boards is often an exercise in sovereignty over competence .
in the rush to recru@@ it business people , they have forgotten something that could be called a bul@@ war@@ k against sport .
what is more , many corporate heav@@ y@@ we@@ ights are not used to intensive media and sometimes also to critical monitoring activities on a personal level .
something that works in a corporate world may not be carried over by sport .
the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian court enforced a life sentence for the killing of three US military personnel .
the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian M@@ ili@@ tary Court of A@@ ppe@@ al imposed a life sentence on Jordan &apos;s sol@@ di@@ er last year for the swe@@ aring of three US military educ@@ ators .
the military tri@@ bun@@ al last month appointed an air@@ base in South Jordan for the killing of Americans for a life imprisonment sentence , with hard work , in exchange for an senior senior se@@ er@@ s@@ ant Mar@@ ik al-@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a .
Al@@ -@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ sk opened a fire against the American car@@ pet by claiming that he had been afraid of an attack on the base .
however , the video on the security cam@@ era published after the decision showed that he also continued the fir@@ ing when two Americans st@@ ole@@ n and dra@@ gged their hands to stop the fir@@ ing .
the U@@ u@@ dis@@ te@@ sat hal@@ a A@@ k@@ h@@ ba@@ r , linked to the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian army , announced on Thursday that the military appeal court with five judges confirmed the sentence for al-Qaeda .
Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ land takes up in a hospi@@ tality role as a series of &apos; O@@ ur life &apos; in another season .
the Ju@@ h@@ ti@@ v@@ producer D@@ an F@@ og@@ el@@ man announced on Thursday , in the context of the Tele@@ vision C@@ ri@@ ti@@ s As@@ soci@@ ation P@@ ress , that the N@@ B@@ C &apos;s popular dram@@ a champion in the next season is set up by Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ one .
the actor turns up as a gu@@ est in K@@ e@@ v@@ in ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Har@@ tle@@ y ) compli@@ city in fil@@ ms at the beginning of the season .
&apos;@@ K@@ e@@ v@@ in plays a major film and we needed a great deal of sympathy &apos; , said F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
at the end of the last season , K@@ e@@ v@@ in was bus@@ y bus@@ y bus@@ y in a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re fil@@ ter by R@@ on Ho@@ war@@ d .
during this season , we can see that the person participa@@ tes in the project and also war@@ ns relations with his own error , which is being played by Mr B@@ re@@ c@@ k@@ en@@ ri@@ dge .
according to F@@ og@@ el@@ man , the Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one &apos; film in which K@@ e@@ v@@ in participa@@ tes is playing an is@@ af@@ ig@@ hu@@ r &apos; .
&apos;@@ The sta@@ r of our life , Mil@@ o V@@ enti@@ mig@@ lia , who plays the father of Har@@ tle@@ y in a series of histor@@ ian images , was played as a coincidence in the film &apos; Ro@@ ck@@ y Bal@@ bo@@ a &apos; with Stalin &apos;s son in 2006 .
F@@ og@@ el@@ man said that V@@ enti@@ mig@@ lia &apos;s still bo@@ om@@ ing friendship , Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one , was probably the one that helped to attract a large sta@@ r to the hospi@@ tality .
&apos;@@ We have a wonderful scenario for him .
I believe that this will be a really exc@@ iting &apos; , saying F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
&apos;@@ O@@ ur life &apos; will return to the the@@ irs on 26 September .
Mr Har@@ ris@@ on sp@@ ends around USD 300 000 a year to keep his body in play .
each of these players is dependent on their own bodies in order to earn their living .
that is why many other bat@@ tles are also investing a great deal of money in the maintenance and restoration of the body in order to stay in top form .
the Je@@ re@@ my F@@ ow@@ ler portal , ES@@ P@@ N@@ .@@ com , looked at how far some ve@@ ter@@ ans are prepared to go in order to extend their career .
however , no case is so extreme as that of the 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , the 14@@ -@@ year-old Pittsburgh S@@ te@@ el guard player .
according to F@@ ow@@ w@@ ler , an annual average of USD 300 000 is spent on me@@ al treatment , mas@@ cul@@ ine ther@@ ap@@ y , chi@@ ro@@ prac@@ tic and pol@@ l@@ ling .
most of the costs relate to travel across the country to meet specialists .
&apos;@@ M@@ y do not need to keep records of these things &apos; , said Har@@ ris@@ on .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you compare the sums earned with my expenditure , the payments are worth that , given how I feel themselves &apos; .
M@@ ike Mitchell , a tra@@ in@@ er of Har@@ ris@@ on , and a team partner in S@@ te@@ el , assessed the annual amount of USD 200 000 as a year of caring for their own body .
3@@ 0-@@ year-old Mitchell has had to rela@@ x the body ( in English &quot; bo@@ dy te@@ m@@ per@@ ing ” , which F@@ ow@@ ler described as &apos; 55 kil@@ o of me@@ tal used as a mas@@ cul@@ ine &apos; .
&apos;@@ The@@ refor@@ e , Mr Mitchell has said it on your head instead of pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating himself &apos; .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you have a few places on your foot and you start moving around to do so , it is sometimes painful .
but , if you stand up , the tension has disappeared immediately .
it simply be@@ at the tension &apos; .
they are ready to make additional efforts , but former N@@ FL@@ -@@ players , Bar@@ ry Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d and R@@ y@@ an Har@@ ris , spend an average of USD 50 000 a year on recovery .
Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d , who played 10 season in the ran@@ ks of New York Gi@@ an@@ ts and Washington Reding , has expressed regret that he was not spending any more .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I could go back , I would invest even more &apos; , Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d said to F@@ ow@@ ler .
&apos;@@ I would probably spend at least twice as much .
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career .
until the end , perhaps more procedures would have been helpful &apos; .
R@@ yan Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old defence player , expressed his readiness to follow in the foot@@ steps of his team partners in S@@ te@@ el .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you pay USD 100 000 and if you play an additional three million , that decision is quite simple &apos; , S@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ er said .
as far as the long term of the career is concerned , investing in the recovery of players is much more intelligent than spending money on cars and cotton .
the average playing field is lu@@ cky if he can play for longer than 30 , all the more so as he succe@@ eds in persu@@ ading his colleagues to direct their costs to the other .
but perhaps they can just find some local specialists .
how P@@ rin@@ ce Di@@ ana used her me@@ tre as a weapon .
when I think of the P@@ rin@@ ce Di@@ ana man , the first thing comes a bridge before the bridge .
a da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter blue in a young age .
a black line later on would appear in his book of Martin B@@ ash@@ ir &apos;s &apos; Pan@@ or@@ am@@ a &apos; inter@@ view , the effects of which were devastating when he looked through the ri@@ ps of the bo@@ xes , bringing the famous dead ph@@ ra@@ ses : &apos; we were mar@@ ried in this life three , so it was a little too popular &apos; .
the great and w@@ et eyes , surroun@@ ded by his dis@@ da@@ in , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous in the face of a bad line , gave him the impression of being w@@ ounded .
that is what he was trying to achieve .
P@@ rin@@ ce from outside the public , with Di@@ ana , never borne a great deal , at least not according to modern standards .
it was not just that he did not need it - he was nice , of course - but he saw a stran@@ g@@ le@@ hold in it , something that is related to work rather than to the substance .
in the public domain , he may have we@@ aring a th@@ in me@@ ig@@ o@@ h .
once upon a time , he arrived in the office of publis@@ hers of Con@@ de N@@ ile , V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , carrying a tan@@ k , almost an or@@ an@@ ge of God .
he a@@ po@@ log@@ ically asked for his sk@@ in to s@@ me@@ ar off the sun as if he were going out &apos; normally &apos; , he would be photo@@ g@@ rap@@ hed by hard pho@@ to@@ s and then put all the accusations that he would see an &apos; du@@ l@@ tery &apos; , &apos; ash &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; .
it is for this reason that Di@@ ana was be@@ having three times a week in an insult , using a machine that is at home .
today , this would , of course , be re@@ pro@@ ac@@ hed for health reasons , but for Mrs Di@@ ana , it had a useful objective , which enabled her to show the world its sun , even though her internal cl@@ ou@@ ds had black cl@@ ou@@ ds and cra@@ cks .
probably one of the biggest mistakes of the Ro@@ y@@ al family was to think that , if they accept him as a hus@@ band of Char@@ les , they would get one of the little relatives of a little w@@ ound who , for the time , only have a sugar poor .
the reality was quite the opposite , however .
he may not have been best at school , but when it came to creating a mira@@ cle , he was a full-@@ blo@@ wn student .
for Di@@ ana , the importance of gender and honey was that it was possible to use them as a fer@@ vent or a reason to trans@@ mit .
otherwise , they did not give him any interest .
his friend , R@@ os@@ a Mon@@ ck@@ ton - a Di@@ ana for his youn@@ gest child - re@@ members that we were not something they used to talk about .
&apos;@@ M@@ y only remember it &apos; , he said , &apos; how reli@@ e@@ ved he felt on those occasions when we went out together and he did not need to me@@ al himself &apos; .
today , we tend to think about a man that improves the woman &apos;s expression , but when you look back on the Di@@ ana &apos;s housing scene , it is clear that she used it as a powerful P@@ R tool .
the moments when he felt the most free of all was his own , are the moments when he was also the most natural , we@@ aring very little honey .
in 1993 , together with its two young bo@@ ys , T@@ hor@@ pe i par@@ g@@ on s@@ ong Le@@ ap@@ i , she was a wa@@ ke@@ -up call and she returned from the heart , under the ban@@ ner &apos;s eye , like any other mother who sp@@ ends a day with children .
four months after he was informed of his departure and that of Char@@ les , he finally found out di@@ am@@ et@@ ric@@ ally concerned and &apos; ordinary &apos; .
or , in later years , in sta@@ mp@@ ing out of a sta@@ g@@ n@@ ant , set up behind the ha@@ ir , in the form of sho@@ es in bic@@ y@@ cles , a face pla@@ gu@@ ed by training , a health and life sp@@ il@@ lo@@ ver from his shop in the evening .
towards the end of his life , when he started to assert his independence and his self-@@ confidence increased , we saw more and more such a Di@@ ana .
he committed himself to H@@ al@@ o T@@ r@@ ust and wal@@ ked through the Ang@@ ol@@ a mine field in January 1997 .
at the time , at the age of 35 , ha@@ ir mil@@ ls and natural - almost entirely na@@ ked - he probably saw the cam@@ era as never before , remembering this bri@@ lli@@ ant and hopeful young gir@@ l who , for 15 years , laugh@@ ed at a po@@ cket .
Di@@ ana was just reaching its best years .
in the early days , a young Di@@ ana S@@ pen@@ cer had the character of a rare R@@ aff@@ ae@@ lic language .
however , it did not take a long time until P@@ R started - a process that was di@@ ri@@ ge@@ led mainly by the plu@@ ral and the pal@@ e to make a young kid@@ ne@@ y out of Di@@ ana , who would be worth the new state of affairs .
this included in part the work of C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ war@@ d , a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ ist man who was often used by L@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ don on photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ s .
the Ho@@ w@@ ard met with a fe@@ ar@@ ful Di@@ an for the first time in the K@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on City in order to record an official bet@@ ting on the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine for V@@ o@@ gu@@ e .
at that point , at the end of the 1980s , Di@@ ana was only an empty pil@@ l .
his most s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated beau@@ ty products were in the eye of T@@ he Bo@@ dy S@@ h@@ op@@ i , for example El@@ der@@ f@@ lo@@ wer .
Mr Ho@@ w@@ ard used the Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor@@ i Ju@@ da@@ e@@ ge , S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us , at the time H@@ one@@ y Tou@@ ch and Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ tor@@ i &apos;s a@@ du@@ l@@ tery tone , the F@@ ro@@ s@@ s C@@ or@@ al .
he put a ba@@ g on the E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den to@@ one R@@ ice and Tim@@ ber@@ l@@ and and , to his cul@@ mination , with a wh@@ im .
the Ex@@ c@@ ell@@ ency was supplemented by the E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den Sy@@ d@@ ne ri@@ ps@@ me@@ tu@@ ch and by a blue con@@ scri@@ ption .
and we know all this , because Mr Ho@@ w@@ ard created a fa@@ d scheme for him .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana &apos;s eyes are so admi@@ rable that I wanted to emphasise their striking presence &apos; , he wrote later .
however , the end result is not particularly attractive for such a young gir@@ l - she sees as 18 years of age as being 50 .
his actions are too op@@ pres@@ sive and too much e@@ ter@@ nal bro@@ therhood on the horiz@@ on .
the most striking thing here , however , is the inf@@ am@@ ous hypo@@ the@@ sis in this ton@@ ic D@@ is@@ ne@@ y P@@ rin@@ ce in the tone .
F@@ an@@ ta@@ asi@@ a@@ th@@ as to fan@@ tas@@ y .
I do not wonder , then , why Di@@ ana is looking at us with a little bit of uncertainty .
one of the sources of Di@@ ana games was the fact that she never knew where a public per@@ s@@ al would end and privacy started .
this was the start of this process .
the person most likely affected by the expression of Di@@ ana was M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l , who still plays an important role in the modern world .
the Me@@ ig@@ u@@ n@@ ster , who is currently a member of C@@ han@@ el , among others , is still one of the world &apos;s population clus@@ ters .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an had an un@@ belie@@ va@@ b@@ ly beautiful sk@@ in and long lo@@ a@@ th@@ es &apos; , re@@ minis@@ cent of it .
&apos;@@ he was just a mira@@ cle .
he was told by the men .
he was sex without trying to do so &apos; .
M@@ ary met Di@@ ana for the first time in 199@@ 1 , when she asked her to award a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine from V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos;s then pe@@ as@@ tic Anna Harkin before December with the most appreciated photo@@ g@@ raph Pat@@ ric@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ li@@ er .
the team also bel@@ on@@ ged to S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h .
this was the case when Di@@ ana and Char@@ les had the greatest a@@ du@@ l@@ tery concerns , and the squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling started in the name of public support .
&apos;@@ they did not tell us who it was , although we knew it was someone &apos;s very famous &apos; , G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l said .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we arrived , Di@@ ana was just fine there , it was so@@ ya and friendly , and it was very ex@@ cited that it could be on the front page of V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos; .
this cap@@ tain picture - Di@@ ana simple k@@ am@@ p@@ sun@@ k , the l@@ un@@ ch@@ et reli@@ ed on his hands , his blue eyes special , cy@@ nical French man@@ ic@@ y@@ or , the ha@@ vo@@ c cut for short - was ground@@ breaking .
it was radi@@ ated from a positive , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and an e@@ leg@@ ant .
above all , it was modern , conve@@ ying a c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine minim@@ alist a@@ es@@ the@@ sis of the early n@@ ine@@ ties and creating a strong contrast between Di@@ ana and the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily , who were faced with &apos; ann@@ us hor@@ ri@@ bes &apos; , as the Qu@@ e@@ en called it later .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana was very stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket on its honey .
he simply wanted to see fresh and different &apos; , Mr Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l said .
in time , he taught Di@@ an@@ a himself as a man - a cre@@ et , a che@@ ese cre@@ et , a pe@@ da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter to raise brid@@ ges , a ri@@ ps@@ me@@ tu@@ ch - and emphasised a healthy sk@@ in rou@@ tine , encouraging him to take good care of himself and follow the man@@ tra &apos; internal beau@@ ty &apos; .
Di@@ ana &apos; did everything moder@@ ately &apos; says Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
he s@@ ma@@ cked enough and reduced alcohol consumption , which is very important for sk@@ in with fresh appearance .
the prin@@ ter preferred the Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in Dec@@ re@@ e , C@@ lar@@ in@@ s and Clin@@ ique i Wil@@ d Ro@@ se .
however , the biggest service that M@@ ary Di@@ ana did was to ali@@ en@@ ate her from a blue in .
&apos;@@ This just made him so much older &apos; , he said .
instead , he used a combination of soft bro@@ thers and neutral ton@@ es with bro@@ w@@ n-@@ line line line line line line line line line line line line line line line that was mutually absor@@ bed , with all the margins being fairly soft .
he often used a fine cre@@ do and a little sun c@@ at to highlight Di@@ ana &apos;s healthy diet .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an used to call me and invite me to discuss products , which I very much enjoyed doing &apos; , said to me by Gre@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
&apos;@@ I think it was fasc@@ in@@ ating for him ; an opportunity to take a few moments for himself &apos; .
his fav@@ ou@@ rite was the luxury br@@ and of C@@ lar@@ in@@ s .
Di@@ ana allegedly used day and night cre@@ ams for their sensitive sk@@ in and their Al@@ p@@ ine plants for clean@@ ing milk and tone .
he also regularly went to Jan@@ et F@@ il@@ der@@ man in the beau@@ ty of Central London .
Di@@ an had a mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous sk@@ in , but sometimes he had a de@@ sp@@ at@@ ch , a moderate sp@@ an , which is often a result of stress .
in order to mitigate this , he used natural cal@@ am@@ ities , including bit@@ ter oil .
&apos;@@ Di@@ an had a wonderful luxury structure &apos; , G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l said .
the only part of his appearance , in which he was not very confident , was his no@@ se .
Ms Harkin rec@@ alls : &apos; once the newspapers have written that she had been to N@@ in@@ a@@ a in a beau@@ ty operation , she turned to me and said , &apos; frankly , if I had allowed my no@@ se to o@@ pe@@ d , don &apos;t you think I would have elected that ? &apos;
when the advice of M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t started to take root , Di@@ ana felt more and more confident about its new appearance .
one of his most enjo@@ y@@ able publi@@ cations - in 1994 in the Ser@@ pen@@ tine gallery in London , where he carried the famous &apos; re@@ tali@@ atory bro@@ ker &apos; , provo@@ king , be@@ d@@ ded by a f@@ ig@@ u@@ re@@ r op@@ pressed by a wh@@ ig@@ u@@ it , Mrs Sta@@ mb@@ oli@@ an , shows that she started to turn her into signals over the past years of her life .
with short and over@@ ti@@ red rhetoric , Di@@ ana is sex and dynamic , in star@@ k contrast to a very challenging black si@@ e@@ ge .
his me@@ al is perfect - lu@@ ke@@ warm but at the same time hu@@ mble , a black bridge highlighting his horiz@@ on .
without fe@@ aring the colour , especially the red , he carried the do@@ se from the do@@ ck to the dec@@ k , probably the Re@@ v@@ l@@ on , which then became a trade@@ mark in some ways .
a few months later , he avoided his e@@ leg@@ ant red man@@ ure in the par@@ en@@ th@@ ood of the E@@ mer@@ gency Fund in the Kingdom College of Justice .
prin@@ ter was a benchmark for health and self-@@ confidence .
finally , he had complete control .
a daily and in a form , his me@@ al , he conve@@ ys exactly what he wants in order for the view@@ ers to think : there is a woman who at last seems to have a sense of self-@@ interest and a purpose in life and who has finally found his place , having just 36 .
it is a real pity that he was not able to prove this to himself .
IA@@ A@@ F war@@ ns that petitions are being closely monitored at the London World C@@ up .
the World C@@ up begins in London on Friday , and a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are in a more intense light than ever with the d@@ oping channels .
these world champi@@ on@@ ships are the first to be dominated by a new body , a@@ th@@ le@@ tics in@@ te@@ ri@@ t Un@@ it ( A@@ I@@ U ) , which also monit@@ ors corruption , gambling and the falsi@@ fication of results .
&apos;@@ cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen .
we can say , however , that we have the best practices and the best anti-@@ d@@ oping programme that can be at all today on the basis of information and data collection , and we will see the result after the event &apos; , David Ho@@ w@@ man , the A@@ U representative , said .
the A@@ I@@ U has allowed 19 a@@ th@@ le@@ tes to compete as neutral a@@ th@@ le@@ tes of some 19@@ 0 Russian a@@ th@@ le@@ tes caught between dro@@ om a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
lea@@ king the tru@@ mp card trans@@ cri@@ es is probably a federal crime , according to the former prosecu@@ tors .
anyone who le@@ ak@@ ed trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of the te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y between President tru@@ mp@@ s and foreign leaders on the press was probably committing a crime , then on Thursday the former prosecu@@ tors stated when the legislators called for an ex@@ tra@@ di@@ tion of the def@@ end@@ ants .
&apos;@@ I@@ m@@ ple@@ men@@ ting these documents without authority to the press is a crime &apos; , said by Jo@@ e G@@ en@@ o@@ va Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws , a former C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia distri@@ ct prosecu@@ tor .
these various acts , which involve public@@ ising the signs of conver@@ sa@@ tions between the President and the leaders of foreign countries and their trans@@ cri@@ ptions , pose a serious threat to national security .
the Washington Po@@ st report , on Thursday , on the basis of the documents le@@ ak@@ ed , about the intensive speeches made by the Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ EN@@ A N@@ ie@@ to and the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Prime Minister , Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l .
the Mexic@@ an Head of State said he would stop pro@@ claiming that his government would not pay for the border wall .
according to the newspaper , trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts contained notes indicating that they have been secre@@ ted by the Supreme Security Council President .
the Po@@ st said that they had integrated trans@@ cri@@ ptions , &apos; made together the White House workers &apos; , based on the White House and key players &apos; records .
&apos;@@ there is a federal legal provision which makes such un@@ authorised information available for a criminal offence , a federal crime &apos; , said by the former New York Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor , D@@ ou@@ g Bur@@ ns , on a telephone inter@@ view .
even though some of the details of these speeches had already come before the public in February , the disclosure of trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts marks a much bigger blow to Val@@ ge@@ le M@@ a@@ da , who is trying to reduce le@@ aks .
the report was published by chance at a time when the leading figures in the tru@@ mp@@ y administration were preparing to step up the public on Friday in order to demonstrate their commitment to sta@@ mp@@ ing out the secre@@ tive information lea@@ kers .
the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor J@@ ef@@ f S@@ es@@ ta , the National In@@ tel@@ ligence Director D@@ an Co@@ at@@ s , the De@@ puty Pro@@ secu@@ tor General General , General R@@ o Ro@@ sen@@ ste@@ in , and Wil@@ li@@ am E@@ van@@ in@@ a , the head of the National Centre for Re@@ fer@@ ence and Security , are expected to famili@@ arise the public with the situation at the headquarters of the Ministry of Justice .
it is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice will examine T@@ he Po@@ st &apos;s lea@@ k .
in order to hold anyone to account for this , according to Bur@@ ns , &apos; strong elements must be proven clearly &apos; .
he said that &apos; there could be some mis@@ gi@@ vings about this &apos; , referring to the investigation of the former Secretary of State , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton , and not to make an accus@@ ation of us .
these considerations include the marks and history of the document and its precise classification .
in the case of secrecy , prosecu@@ tors will examine whether the document was le@@ ak@@ ed to an un@@ authorised person in such a way as to adver@@ sely affect the interests of the United States .
&apos;@@ I@@ f all this can be proven , people can undoubtedly be crimin@@ ally vulnerable &apos; , said in Bur@@ ns .
&apos;@@ There is no doubt &apos; .
when it comes to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of tru@@ mp@@ s , the G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was the prosecu@@ tor for sp@@ ying cases , said that such documents were &apos; usually clas@@ sed as secret and higher &apos; .
by claiming that these sp@@ il@@ ls threaten the ability of the US Government to conduct foreign policy , it ap@@ pealed to the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor of Di@@ en@@ o@@ va to con@@ vene a federal , criminal pan@@ el of mas@@ ters to find lec@@ ture@@ rs .
he also said that , in order to obtain the letter of The Washington Po@@ st re@@ por@@ ters and ed@@ it@@ ors &apos; telephone calls , there should be a trial - something against which re@@ por@@ ters would no doubt be prote@@ sting .
the U@@ TA@@ H Re@@ publi@@ can Sen@@ ator , M@@ ike Le@@ e , said on Thursday by Cap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill that criminal proceedings should take place in the case of lea@@ king classified information .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you have to find the person who le@@ ak@@ ed them - you have to be punished and , in addition , you have to dis@@ miss them &apos; , said in Le@@ e F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a &apos; Ne@@ ws H@@ Q &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is unacceptable and this should never happen &apos; .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before being elected in the Senate in 2010 , said that such a lea@@ k was &apos; a crime , a very serious federal crime &apos; .
&apos;@@ such a move should not and should not only be accompanied by dis@@ mis@@ sal , but also criminal proceedings , given that classified information is involved &apos; , said to him .
it was said to F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws that , at this stage , a Friday announcement by the Ministry of Justice could provide an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , rather than explain certain procedures .
last week , President S@@ es@@ sion@@ s criticised and publicly p@@ ou@@ sed his an@@ ger to the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor , claiming that he has not made enough effort to find lec@@ ture@@ rs .
&apos;@@ M@@ y want the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tor to be much more harsh about the lea@@ ks coming from the security agencies &apos; , said the tru@@ m@@ p on 25 July in Ro@@ se .
in S@@ es@@ si@@ ons itself , last week F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws Tu@@ c@@ ker Car@@ l@@ son admitted that he was not happy with the efforts made to investigate the lea@@ ks that have repeatedly been e@@ rec@@ ting obstacles for the President since his in@@ augu@@ ration .
&apos;@@ M@@ y was not happy with earlier proceedings and investigations into criminal le@@ aks &apos; , said S@@ ici@@ ons .
even some people who are critical of the President have spoken out against the le@@ aks , saying that such practices are detrimental to foreign policy efforts .
&apos;@@ The trans@@ cri@@ ption of the speech between the President and the Head of State is outrageous , shocking and dangerous &apos; , David f@@ ru@@ m wrote on Thursday at@@ lan@@ tic@@ us .
&apos;@@ It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidenti@@ ally - and perhaps even more importantly - so that foreign leaders understand that they can provide a confidenti@@ al response &apos; .
Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ar@@ ner ( D@@ -@@ V@@ a ) , the leader of the Senate Security Committee , also said to Mr Da@@ ily B@@ ear@@ t that the page is &apos; absolutely worrying &apos; and that Congress should examine it .
the American na@@ val base was ordered to be removed from the post box in the surroun@@ dings dep@@ ic@@ ting the American flag .
Er@@ us is at the heart of the dispute between the US ve@@ ter@@ an and the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da L@@ ord &apos;s Union with the post bu@@ tton covered by the American flag .
Er@@ us , an American na@@ val officer , John A@@ ck@@ ert , says he received a letter last week from the H@@ ous@@ th@@ wood Association which he was asked to remove or face a punishment from the post office in an surroun@@ ded by the national flag .
he said to the W@@ C@@ TV that he was not going to sur@@ render without fighting and that he had made an appeal .
&apos;@@ Con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ate to this , frankly speaking , as a bul@@ war@@ k &apos; said by A@@ ck@@ er@@ t .
and I think people should fight any form of bul@@ lying , especially that .
as Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said , his post does not comply with the es@@ thetic values of Sou@@ th@@ wood .
a US na@@ val steel , John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , said he had to remove his post office in an American flag .
as a result of your approach to the end of the holiday season , we ask you to remove from the post office the symbols dep@@ ic@@ ting the American flag &apos; , communic@@ ating the letter .
the tri@@ m@@ ming@@ s may be outside 30 days , and after 15 days at the latest they have to be taken down .
he said that there have been four years in the surroun@@ dings .
it moved to the house in 30 days &apos; time .
the messages to the H@@ ous@@ th@@ wood H@@ ous@@ ing Association did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning .
a neighbour of A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said to the W@@ C@@ T@@ V@@ s that the letter was a bit harsh and was not particularly surprised by the activities of the Union of home@@ owners .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is what they do all the time &apos; , said by Mr Ste@@ p@@ h@@ en@@ son .
in my opinion , this is ridiculous .
why not be patri@@ otic in one &apos;s own country ?
M@@ ike P@@ A@@ T@@ EL said : &apos; this is a ve@@ ter@@ an who served our country .
it is just a ban@@ ner of the post .
I do not think this is right .
the house belongs to him , at least that could be allowed .
a letter from the Association of C@@ i@@ vi@@ ans states that A@@ ck@@ er@@ t has 15 days to remove , otherwise he will be faced with a fine .
he has not received an answer to his appeal .

any re@@ medi@@ al work for the former agency will , of course , remain in my eyes now , whether it is in the forest or in the field .
the mach@@ ines and the quality of the works have improved significantly , and everything is happening more effectively than in the past .
at present , reconstruction is mainly carried out in the past , as well as the search for errors and congestion , and as an improvement in them .
in addition , stricter environmental standards have been added to which attention was not paid decades ago .
building materials have been renewed , such as p@@ las@@ tic pi@@ pes are now being used in the construction of tram@@ ples instead of past iron pi@@ pes , and the ther@@ mal to@@ w@@ ers are being used in addition to st@@ oning , a so-called &apos; geo@@ textiles &apos; .

report : Mu@@ el@@ ler called a pan@@ el of senior men in his investigation into Russia .
the Wall S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal announced on Thursday that a Special Pro@@ secu@@ tor investigating possible relations between Russia and D@@ on@@ al@@ d P@@ re@@ mp@@ hal@@ ania had conven@@ ed a pan@@ el of old men .
the page states that the House of De@@ pu@@ ties represents a new and significant step forward in the investigation by the Special Pro@@ secu@@ tor , Robert Mu@@ el@@ ler , into whether the tru@@ ce or his main advi@@ sers held a secret campaign to promote the P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential Mo@@ vement with Moscow in 201@@ 6 .
N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has stated in the past that , before Mu@@ el@@ ler , Govern@@ or of the former F@@ B@@ I , who is now in charge of this critical investigation , had been appointed , public prosecu@@ tors were using the mas@@ ters of the former national security advi@@ ser , Michael F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ ni , and a tru@@ mp@@ i former head of the campaign , Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ t , as part of his investigation into the activities .
one of the President &apos;s personal lawyers , John D@@ O@@ W@@ D , said to N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws that he was not aware that Mu@@ el@@ ler had started to use the full force of the old men .
&apos;@@ We have been working with Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler and his team since 1 June because we want to get to the bottom of this &apos; , he said .
in the light of the news of the conven@@ ing of a f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist old man as a whole , we have no reason to think that the President is under investigation .
the N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws has not confirmed J@@ our@@ n@@ al data independently .
the full use of older men is a normal part of a complex investigation , and is not a tool designed only to listen to testi@@ mon@@ ies , but also to obtain information and obtain data from individuals or companies .
it is a powerful tool that prosecu@@ tors may use to apply for prosecu@@ tions and in@@ vita@@ tions to court , and it may indicate that the work of Mu@@ el@@ ler is far from being done .
the tru@@ mp card has denied that he or any member of his team had a plan with Russia during the 201@@ 6 presidential campaign .
Moscow &apos;s officials have also denied playing a part in the surprising victory of the temp@@ o in November last year .
the President &apos;s special advi@@ ser , T@@ y C@@ ob@@ b , said that he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using a new old man .
&apos;@@ The old men &apos;s collection is usually secret &apos; , said in the C@@ ob@@ b statement .
the White House is in favour of everything that spe@@ eds up the fair conclusion of its work .
the White House is fully committed to working with Mugabe .
the former director of the B@@ I , J@@ im Com@@ e@@ y , said three times that the President was not under investigation , and we have no reason to think that things have changed &apos; .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an bank Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Bank is accused of large-scale money la@@ undering abuses .
on Thursday , the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Government accused Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Bank of large-scale infringements of the rules against money la@@ undering and terrorist financing against the country &apos;s largest mortgage .
the Financial In@@ tel@@ ligence Agency A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C revealed that it has initiated a civil punishment procedure against Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k in a federal court due to the &apos; serious and systematic non-@@ conformity &apos; in A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an biggest case and the first one where a large bank is accused .
&apos;@@ Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k &apos;s behaviour in this matter has left un@@ protected A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an society in terms of serious and lasting financial crime &apos; , said in the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C case .
Com@@ mon@@ we@@ al@@ th Bank said in his statement that they would investigate the charges more closely and respond &apos; when the time is right &apos; .
the largest A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an mortgage lending &apos; at the right time or not at all &apos; announced dubious facts &apos; concerning transactions in total to over 77 million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an dollars ( USD 61 million ) , was reported by A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C .
according to the Agency , the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of money la@@ undering and anti-@@ terrorist financing instruments , particularly with regard to so-called &apos; intelligent payment mach@@ ines &apos; .
the previous largest case of this kind was linked earlier this year to the Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p Hol@@ dings inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor of the most popular bet@@ ting in Australia , who had only 108 alleged offences .
Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p paid out 45 million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an dollars and is the biggest civilian punishment in A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an corporate history .
the A@@ U@@ S@@ TR@@ AC@@ s representative refused to comment on the possible Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k penalty or whether there may be other banks on the Agency &apos;s line of fire .
the maximum sentence in the event of contra@@ vention of the law against money la@@ undering and terrorist financing is USD 18 million for breach of Australia .
intelligent payment mach@@ ines are a specific type of bank au@@ tom@@ o@@ bi@@ les that accept both cash and che@@ que contributions and facilitate the cash for anon@@ ymous contributions .
according to A@@ U@@ S@@ TR@@ AC@@ s , the use of In@@ telli@@ gent Pay@@ ment A@@ re@@ as has increased significantly since they were introduced in May 2012 .
the cash contributions amoun@@ ted to 5.@@ 8 billion Australia in the six months before June 201@@ 6 , compared to USD 89 million in Australia in the first six months of the launch of the Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k A@@ p@@ pro@@ as .
A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C claims in court documents that cash was paid from a false name , so that income was obtained for drug importing sy@@ nd@@ ro@@ me .
&apos;@@ even after the attention of the Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k was drawn to a suspect for money la@@ undering or &apos; s@@ oo@@ thing &apos; in the Com@@ mb@@ an@@ k accounts , the Com@@ m@@ Ban@@ k did not start monitoring its cli@@ ents in order to make it difficult and manage the financing of money la@@ undering and terrorism &apos; , the judicial documents show .
the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C added that the Com@@ m@@ bank accounts were also used to &apos; scra@@ p &apos; , which is a form of money la@@ undering involving transfers between countries without actually having to cross international borders .
two influential women share their record of success .
what do we have in common with Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an and La@@ il@@ a A@@ l ?
at first gl@@ ance , these women come from two completely different worl@@ ds .
the New York real es@@ tate camp , Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ can@@ an , was able to conver@@ t a thousand dollars &apos; loan into a 5 billion worth of real es@@ tate firm before applying its expertise on a te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y scre@@ en by participating in the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s serious living and conver@@ ting &apos; S@@ har@@ k Tan@@ k &apos; of &apos; In@@ ves@@ t@@ ments &apos; .
La@@ il@@ a Ali has been following the foot@@ steps of his father by becoming the most successful female bo@@ y of a four@@ -@@ times un@@ win@@ ge@@ able champion , before the roles of the television leader , author and speaker were added to his past .
despite these unique career paths ( or perhaps because of them ) , both women in T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x were recru@@ ited to help them talk about breaking stereotypes and achieving ambitious targets for the latter .
last year , T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x spoke to hundreds of women in the shops across the country and found that 80 % of them felt that society had ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ ped with solid roles and expectations .
consequently , they have come up with a project called The Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t to help women break these barriers .
Cor@@ can@@ on and Ali know a lot about this ; they may be at the top of their business by now , but the journey there was not going well for either .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an was mainly awarded a &apos; D &apos; in secondary school and col@@ leges and had worked in 20 jobs for 23 years .
Ali entered one of the most male areas and , on top of that , faced a challenge on his path to try to step up the the@@ ft of his father , who was an out@@ mo@@ ded i@@ ko@@ on .
these two , to put it mil@@ dly , are s@@ lee@@ ping through the knowledge acquired by the difficulties .
that is why we sat down with these influential women in order to talk about overcoming failings , cop@@ ing with success , and our sense of confidence in business and relations .
what in@@ spi@@ res do you to do what you do on a daily basis ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am inspired by my personal goals every day .
I have taken the ha@@ bit of telling things that I want to achieve .
and I look at that list .
I consider myself responsible .
I am , of course , inspired by my children .
I am inspired by my ambition .
I wish to be vic@@ tori@@ ous for everything that I do in life .
I understand that achieving my objectives requires hard work , but I am ready to do so .
my confidence comes from preparation .
so I will take a lot of time to prepare .
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : like La@@ il@@ k@@ u , the key to my confidence is this type of preparation , but I will not draw my inspiration from it .
in fact , I am inspired by the she@@ er cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what happens if I do so ?
what will be left if I do not do so ?
this cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity makes me rise from a bed this morning because I cannot wait for what the day brings .
if I do not know about it in a few days , I will simply pre@@ tend these senti@@ ments .
then I am left to believe in my own trouble and I will take inspiration again .
talk about some of the obstacles in your career , which made you even better in the long term .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : for me , the most difficult thing was when my business partner left me behind and my secre@@ tary was lu@@ cky .
I finished business a year later , but this year in my life - the fifth whe@@ el - was horri@@ fying because I did not have enough confidence to leave .
I felt defe@@ ated , there was no inspiration .
however , amaz@@ ing things happen .
the most difficult thing is to believe in those moments when you are hit by the set@@ backs .
it was an extremely difficult year to get down to business and start it from scra@@ t@@ ch , this time without a partnership .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I would say that my career was the most difficult time when I was involved in bo@@ xing , I was at the top of my career and decided to introduce divorce .
I not only separated from my hus@@ band , but also from the then M@@ oun@@ tain and someone who taught me all I know about bo@@ xing .
I did not believe that I could do without him .
so I started to worry about the future of my career and I had to find time to take a step back and say to myself : &apos; you have all the knowledge and experience required .
you have all these experiences in the bo@@ xing cir@@ cles .
you can certainly do it &apos; .
so I set up a new team around me and continued my career .
in fact , it was simply necessary to reach the right mind , as all the rest of it was given a boost .
I did what needed to be done , I had to face fear and have the courage to get rid of my hus@@ band and mountain and to continue with my career .
when did you feel that you have really made progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I felt that I had succeeded in win@@ ning my first ca@@ talo@@ gue of champi@@ on@@ ships .
it was a really good feeling because , when I started bo@@ xing , I wanted to be one of the best , un@@ win@@ ning .
I was able to achieve this objective , and I did not win the title of the champi@@ on@@ ship in one , but four .
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : one moment when I felt I had made progress was my ele@@ ven year of operation .
I was at the end of the day .
I had earned a profit of around USD 42 000 , which I could not expect .
I went out straight away and bought a new car for both the mother and the father ; they never had a new car ; I allowed the cars to go to F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ as where they had their retirement .
I felt like the Qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I felt so bl@@ ind@@ ly .
I served much more in the coming years , but nothing has so far been able to offer the same sense of feeling as an opportunity to give my parents something back and cure them with a surprise .
for this 1@@ 1-@@ year-old period , how could you keep yourself motivated in order to continue working ?
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : I never measured my business by profit , because that was not my aim .
I just wanted to see how far I can get .
I already set myself the dream of having a New York house K@@ ing on the first day .
and I saw myself am@@ using as a P@@ ope - everybody is running my finger and go@@ ating me .
I had such a small point in my head .
so , when I made every effort every day , every hour , I did not really think about ear@@ ning money .
in the end , I pay the money ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tally .
but I immediately returned all the money in .
I do not even believe that I had a da@@ un@@ ting day at all , where I would have thought that o@@ h God , we would not make money .
I was simply convinced that something would work .
the worst thing that could have happened would have been to lose the company and to become a pretext again .
I will have a good drin@@ k and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
therefore , I do not believe that the great aspi@@ ration of many people who have made progress is money .
they have other incentives to s@@ pu@@ r them .
and the money was not one of my own .
do you have any advice to someone who has such great dre@@ ams but who is being held back by the financial factor ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : when I started ear@@ ning a lot of money , I had money to invest in property , but I did not have time .
I was a company in R@@ a@@ ja@@ ina .
and that is why I found five different partners , not even specialists in the squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling , but in different neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds across the city , who felt the streets and explo@@ ded .
I approached them and said : &apos; you know the neighbourhood .
you can find the best building for me .
I will give you money and you will be my partner .
the lesson here is that if you have money , you need people to earn money from your own money .
and if you have a gi@@ ft , then you could sell it to someone who has money and make money from it .
there are two aspects : An@@ ne and money .
but if there are not both together , nothing very big will happen .
at the end of the day , I - and my partners too - have worked very well over all these years with those large investors that I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find com@@ ba@@ tive people who like to as@@ simil@@ ate .
it is always possible to obtain money if you believe that you have an tal@@ ent and feel better than anyone else in your part of the world .
we are talking about the morning : what are the two or three things that you do every morning , which will help you make progress ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I do not know about you , but I have many moments in life when I feel over-@@ burden@@ ed , being a mother , a business hus@@ band ... all the roles we play as a woman .
I arrived at a point in my life where I really had to put a rou@@ tine of this morning in place .
I like to rise up and just feel thank@@ ful .
gratitude for up@@ rising , for his health , for his children , for his family .
I frequently write up what my objectives are for next day ; when I wake up , I look at the list again .
Me@@ di@@ as@@ ta@@ ine .
I sometimes write in a r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ical context .
I always have a cu@@ p of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
and I always do the first thing in the morning , because if I do not do so , it will not .
for me , this is ultimately about priorities .
these are things that are important to me : my spi@@ ral , my focus on the uni@@ verse and God , then training and putting our health first .
thanks to this , everything seems simple .
I feel that I can con@@ qu@@ er all the challenges that come down on my path in the course of the day .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ can@@ an : I put things in order .
I will work through my list of tasks , which is endless and ridiculous .
and I will set out what is most important .
what are the real priorities ?
I will try to live with these most important things .
what are you doing to bring yourself into the right m@@ ood ?
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : I imagine I would fail .
bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re as it may be .
I think I@@ ss@@ and , I fail .
I be@@ g myself and that makes me make more effort .
I imagine anyone who is competing with me - I am very com@@ ba@@ tive in nature because I am one in ten children and we never received enough attention from our parents .
I can be very competi@@ tively .
and I always come in too thoroughly prepared .
over-@@ pre@@ pare@@ dness will strengthen my confidence .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : it is amaz@@ ing how confron@@ ta@@ tional we are in this respect .
we are two successful people , and this shows how different things work for different people .
I like to imagine that I will be successful .
I like to think about the end , which is a success .
I imagine that in the spirit , I actually see it happening .
I see bo@@ xing around , fighting , win@@ ning myself as a win@@ ner and returning to a clo@@ th@@ es room , celebrating a victory with a piece of work , as I have always done .
the same applies to meetings .
this self-@@ confidence is precisely due to preparation , however , as the fear in the pu@@ ck is that I am not going well or that I am not going to say the right things or that I do not have the information I need .
this is where the preparations for the game are , for me .
but I always enter by thro@@ wing the end result down .
you have both been very successful in your career .
how will you pass it on ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am very cu@@ rious to be part of the T@@ .@@ J@@ . M@@ A@@ X@@ I project Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t because I feel it is an opportunity to do well .
a large number of women need inspiration , encouragement for them to achieve their dre@@ ams and objectives .
we are all in the champion .
it is , in fact , a matter of m@@ ood and of having the necessary tools , around them with the right people , with the people who have been able to achieve the things that you are trying to achieve .
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ an : one of the things I think I do very well is to insp@@ ire people .
I was therefore very ex@@ cited when I was asked to cooperate with Mr Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
I will try to take the ba@@ r of indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward .
many people are making the start of putting their dre@@ ams into practice , but tend to be wrong at some point .
so we are trying to help them to focus on the cause .
everything we teach is practical .
sub-@@ standard , even such a simple thing as a li@@ f@@ tic speech , everything that is needed to set up a company .
what advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in male areas ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am acting in one of the most male areas , which is half .
it was quite discoura@@ ging to come after my father , who was a global w@@ et and an all-@@ time good .
for me , the cru@@ x of the matter was actually to find this tal@@ ent , courage , strength in itself .
the first thing I had to believe was that I could sit around and succeed .
at the time , no one was concerned with the other but myself and I had no provision for restrictions other than those that I had set myself in my head .
if you believe in yourself and find your passion , no one can stop you .
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ an : the road between finding an inspiration and taking a stance like me - &apos; New York &apos;s K@@ ing of real es@@ tate &apos; - and crossing the fin@@ ishing line is enormously long .
and in this interim phase , which is your career career every day , many tal@@ ents are needed .
in order to need these tal@@ ents , there is no need to act with property delays .
I am sure that in the La@@ il@@ a area , too , it was necessary to decide what the right people are , the right M@@ oun@@ tains , when to start , when you can finish , how much money you can put in , what you cannot do when you are prepared to work .
these are all subjec@@ tive decisions .
I will try to build on these efforts a little so that these women really feel &apos; o@@ kay , I have understood .
let me try .
here I have three priorities .
if they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen , I will be s@@ mil@@ ing at home in the evening .
what is your din@@ ner now ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : too much y@@ el@@ low .
ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , books , small pal@@ e wine , my day .
probably on water .
Mrs Cor@@ cor@@ an : my night has a small , green wa@@ ke@@ -up call , because I tried to break the ha@@ bit of looking at the telephone every morning .
that is why I came up with it .
it was s@@ mi@@ le .
but it has never worked .
and still stands there .
and my telephone is still at my din@@ ner .
what book do you read now ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ car@@ an : an eigh@@ th or n@@ in@@ th times it says , &apos; Ho@@ w win friends and influence people &apos; .
this is keeping me on the right track .
I believe that this is still the best book written in this area , which makes no distinction between what your dre@@ ams are ; dre@@ ams cannot be achieved without other people .
and it is possible to deal with this today just as in the past .
I like to re@@ count it from time to time .
this will enable me to get back on track .
La@@ il@@ a Ali : I am stu@@ dying a di@@ e@@ tary school , which is why I am reading a book entitled N@@ u@@ g@@ y-@@ free di@@ e@@ et .
it is about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies .
I am very interested in this .
what is your best advice to deal with successes and failures ?
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : ignore the pessimis@@ ts .
they are met in all sorts of different forms .
you have to remove their bra@@ ins from their vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
keep out of the v@@ ans .
they are looking at you with energy .
I take the wh@@ i@@ p as the the@@ at@@ re .
they come at night , they are short of their pockets and they are leaving .
the pessimis@@ ts are destroying any team in a situation more quickly than you can look the other way , because people who paraly@@ se themselves want others to feel badly .
they are pul@@ ling out good people with themselves .
I can perfectly avoid all negative people within the 50 km radi@@ us , because my aim is to be positive and to take everything from life and to accept everything that I have to offer .
so why should I want to spend a minute on such people ?
La@@ il@@ a Ali : you have to be consistent .
we start on many occasions with conviction that we are now taking this path .
we will do that , and that is what we are doing .
however , people will not follow it for long enough .
sometimes they give up just before they reach the final villa@@ ge .
so I think we need to stay on track .
if you feel passion@@ ate about something , if you believe in something , then you have to be consistent .
and you have to do the hard work that success requires .
Mrs Cor@@ can@@ or@@ an : you have to work hard to ensure continuity .
do you know what is needed for this ?
fin@@ alising things .
if you start with something , you stop it .
many are some skil@@ ful buil@@ ders , but not particularly some gradu@@ ates .
Chinese Internet cen@@ sors play a complex game of c@@ at and mo@@ use .
according to the experts , the shift that may affect a large number of users , from researchers to companies , indicates that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet .
&apos;@@ It seems that the restrictions are becoming more and more intense but , at the same time , the Internet is more powerful than ever &apos; , E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , who has written a book entitled &apos; no@@ w I k@@ no@@ w W@@ h@@ o m@@ y Com@@ ra@@ des A@@ re &apos; on the influence of the Internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
the restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China .
according to the experts , China has not yet strengthened its controls and , in many cases , the game of c@@ at and mo@@ use continues .
one day after A@@ pp@@ le &apos;s performance last week , people started to spread in the Chinese social media the way to have access to these tools , which are so simple that they can even use a technical stran@@ ger .
this included the registration of a person &apos;s application shop to another country where V@@ P@@ N applications are still available .
nevertheless , Thursday shows that China wants to change the game for the benefit of the c@@ at .
several Chinese Internet service providers said on Thursday , in their social media accounts , their websites or in our rooms , that Chinese security officials would test a new way of finding an Internet address for services that would maintain or use illegal content .
once they have been found , the authorities , according to these companies , are asking that Internet service providers demand that their customers stop doing so .
if customers continue , service providers and Chinese officials will cut them off with Community minutes .
the Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the fa@@ ke request to comment on the matter .
studies indicate that in China tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people use V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ and other types of sof@@ tw@@ are to by@@ pass the Great C@@ up .
although the bloc@@ ka@@ des of foreign television broadcas@@ ts and pornography de@@ ter many people , they present little challenges to China &apos;s enormously large web users community .
the Chinese President , X@@ I J@@ in@@ p@@ ing , has been responsible for the new elements of internet control over the years , but he has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors in China &apos;s future economic development .
since cyber@@ space has begun to play a more central role with regard to the whole of China , government control elements have evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to find out the extent of the new efforts , as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly , fe@@ aring to be compli@@ cit in the Chinese Government &apos;s dis@@ da@@ in .
some frequent users , however , have said that circum@@ vention of restrictions is becoming more and more difficult .
a student who is stu@@ dying in the United States and returned to China for summer leave said that he had been blocked by the local V@@ P@@ N .
in his own words , he took this period as a kind of se@@ mb@@ l@@ ance away from the social media and he left F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k with his friends a message to explain why he had ground down as if .
a P@@ h@@ D student at one university in China said that without Google IT@@ A , it has become more difficult to carry out research , even though the university has found alternative prin@@ ted so that students do not always need the Internet .
according to his own asser@@ tion , he has now found a new way of by@@ passing the Great Tu@@ rin , without dis@@ closing what it is all about .
some V@@ P@@ N@@ s still work , according to Chinese Internet observers , and China could do much more to intensify the restrictions .
&apos;@@ We believe that , if the government had decided to do so , it would have stopped V@@ P@@ N much more &apos; , said V@@ P@@ N@@ Da@@ da , a website that was created in 2015 , which would help to find V@@ P@@ N for Chinese users .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the government had sent out more in its po@@ cket , the Chinese would be much more complicated &apos; , the representative who refused to appoint himself to China because of the sensitivity of the group &apos;s work .
&apos;@@ I@@ f they did not , because they have to give people or companies some brea@@ thing space &apos; .
China &apos;s online restrictions are often cyclical .
the current climate is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party , which will be held in the autumn by the 19@@ th Congress .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ N had un@@ foreseen disrup@@ tions at the time before a similar meeting .
like economic policy or external affairs , censorship in China is also part of a complex and often lacking political process .
according to analy@@ sts , government minis@@ tries feel pres@@ su@@ ri@@ sed on the eve of Congress that they are effective and able to intervene if there is a problem .
&apos;@@ The@@ refor@@ e , therefore , it is certainly not V@@ P@@ N &apos;s a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ sis &apos; , said Paul Tri@@ ol@@ o , the head of the consultation company E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia G@@ ro@@ u@@ p , the world technological depart@@ ment .
&apos;@@ a more difficult environment for users to na@@ vig@@ ate , and new opportunities and approaches will make it easier for China to simply shut out certain parts of the V@@ P@@ N &apos;s use during and in the chosen place in Beijing &apos; , he said .
the Chinese population will learn to overcome these difficulties in an early age .
earlier this summer , the Chinese Internet gi@@ ant , T@@ en@@ c@@ ent , started to limit the time during which younger than 18 have been allowed to play a popular web game called &apos; H@@ on@@ or of K@@ ing &apos; , enabling an hour to be done for those who are under 12 and for two hours , those who are aged 12 to 18 .
that is why young people in China have started using a age@@ -@@ old solution : false documents .
&apos;@@ is your &apos; H@@ on@@ or of K@@ ing &apos; speaking time restricted ?
are you interested in getting a document that shows that you are older than 18 ? &apos; a recent adver@@ t asked in the social media in China .
&apos;@@ There is no problem .
make the Community available in order to obtain a document cheap@@ ly &apos; .
he was pra@@ ised for ob@@ struc@@ ting a global cyber attack .
and then he was arrested .
when the out@@ p@@ ouring from K@@ ron@@ o was first adver@@ tised in Russian under@@ ground forums in 2014 , the questionable price of 7 000 dollars indicated for this that the sale of bad property was a lu@@ cra@@ tive undertaking .
the K@@ ron@@ o was adver@@ tised as a tool for dis@@ car@@ ding data , including u@@ ser@@ -@@ name names and pa@@ ro@@ l , P@@ IN@@ -@@ works for cash mach@@ ines and personal information which is useful for breaking up security issues .
M@@ o@@ th@@ er@@ bo@@ ard announced on Thursday that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ s was detained at L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as airport after a weekend at the Security Con@@ fer@@ ences B@@ la@@ ck H@@ at and D@@ ef@@ c@@ on .
he had plans to fly back to his home in Britain .
the Tur@@ be@@ k community reacted to arrest its appreciated sta@@ r with surprise and scepticism .
some warned that requirements against Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s could undermine the relationship between &apos; white &apos; cra@@ cks - investi@@ g@@ ators who seek weak sof@@ tw@@ are points for identifying and solving problems , not committing crimes or freezing chaos - and law enforcement agencies .
others hesi@@ tated to take the view that Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in could have created such sof@@ tw@@ are as an attack .
in July 2014 , he asked in T@@ wit@@ ter , and no one has any face of K@@ ron@@ os , which is a seem@@ ingly cu@@ rious request when he himself was the author of bad property .
although the exact details of the connection with Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ si K@@ ron@@ os &apos;s the@@ ft are not clear , security investi@@ g@@ ators in search of vulnerable places on the computer code have often ignored legal problems .
in recent years , the major technical companies have put forward a &apos; pat@@ ch@@ work of errors &apos; in order to form@@ alise the process of reporting problems and compensa@@ ting researchers for their work .
there has also been a ten@@ se relationship with the law enforcement authorities at the D@@ ef@@ con@@ i conference , at the gathering of security experts from all over the world without restrictions .
in 2002 , for example , the F@@ B@@ I was arrested by a Russian ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic expert in the L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as ho@@ tel room following the publication of sof@@ tw@@ are , which , according to the authorities , could damage the security of certain types of e-@@ books .
the E@@ le@@ c@@ tron@@ ic Fron@@ ti@@ er F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ ti@@ on , in his statement , said that he was concerned about the arrest of Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s and would examine the matter more closely .
W@@ an@@ na C@@ ry L@@ and conta@@ cted compu@@ ters which worked on the parents of Mic@@ ro@@ soft W@@ ind@@ o@@ ws .
after the spread , sof@@ tw@@ are compu@@ ters were c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted and users &apos; files were lu@@ mped , cap@@ tive and chain .
when the infected devices were connected with the network , other online devices could also be infected .
the agg@@ res@@ sors insisted that the victims would pay hundreds of dollars to b@@ it@@ che@@ n at the address .
the Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in became a &apos; ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal her@@ o &apos; .
in an inter@@ view given to Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an in May , Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins said that he would register online after he discovered that mal@@ ig@@ n@@ ant sof@@ tw@@ are were trying to make contact with it .
by regis@@ tering for the ten@@ or of USD 10@@ .@@ 69 , he launched the so-called slaugh@@ ter@@ house , which stopped the proliferation of sof@@ tw@@ are .
his original intention was not to stop the attack , but to monitor its spread .
Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins , who is a rese@@ ar@@ cher of K@@ ry@@ p@@ to Lo@@ gi@@ c , a cyber@@ security company in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , said in an inter@@ view that he was not in the College and had learned to write sof@@ tw@@ are for himself .
the company did not make its comments .
Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins tried to remain anon@@ ymous , in contact with the media with their constant Mal@@ wa@@ re@@ T@@ ec@@ h , but British tab@@ lo@@ ids revealed their identity .
he was pra@@ ised in the cyber@@ security community for this achievement and was given special recognition by the industry at S@@ C A@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ s Europe .
the tru@@ m@@ b described New H@@ amp@@ shire as &apos; nar@@ c@@ our@@ a &apos; , thus referring to State politicians .
&apos;@@ The President is wrong &apos; , said New H@@ amp@@ shire &apos;s Re@@ publi@@ can Govern@@ or , Ch@@ ris S@@ un@@ un@@ u .
it is disappointing that his mis@@ representation of the epidemic igno@@ res all the excellent that the State has to offer .
se@@ na@@ tor Mag@@ gi@@ e H@@ ass@@ an , a democra@@ t in New H@@ amp@@ shire , mentioned the comments &apos; dis@@ gus@@ ting &apos; and said in T@@ wit@@ ter that his state of affairs is no different from the others fighting for the misuse of widespread op@@ i@@ ates .
se@@ na@@ tor Je@@ an@@ ne s@@ ha@@ he@@ en , as well as the democra@@ t , agreed .
&apos;@@ It is totally unacceptable for the President to speak of the N@@ HS in this way &apos; , he wrote in T@@ wit@@ ter .
it is completely wrong to por@@ tra@@ y the N@@ H and the epidemic .
organ addiction - a category of drugs that includes hero@@ in and f@@ en@@ tan@@ y@@ l - is the most dead@@ ly drug epidemic in American history .
a drug over@@ do@@ se killed more people than weapons or accidents in 201@@ 6 - estimated to be 59 000 people according to the figures analysed in the New York Times - and is the main cause of death for the Americans under 50 .
in 2015 , more than 97 million people in the United States consumed anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs with a prescription , according to data from the Agency for M@@ ental Health .
it is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not determined by the doctor .
New H@@ amp@@ shire has been hit hard and its people repeatedly raised the problem with the presidential candidates during the 201@@ 6 campaign .
the New H@@ amp@@ shire mark was estimated at 4@@ 70 over@@ do@@ ses in 201@@ 6 , compared with 4@@ 39 cases in 2015 .
in 2012 , they were 16@@ 3 in New H@@ amp@@ shire , according to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Services .
on Thursday , S@@ un@@ u described the op@@ i@@ ates epidemic in us as &apos; one of the worst health crises ever faced by the State &apos; .
he said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention , treatment and recovery .
he says that the state has also spent millions of dollars on prevention programmes for children , legal protection to stop drug trafficking and initiatives to make it more accessible for a jo@@ ke that is used for over@@ do@@ ses .
D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s long-@@ time advi@@ ser and leader Mar@@ ty S@@ k@@ la@@ r died at 8@@ 3-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old age .
S@@ k@@ la@@ r , who died at his home in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Hol@@ ly@@ wood H@@ ill@@ si &apos;s neighbourhood on 27 July , maintained contact with the company after a retirement in 2009 , which was precisely due to the 5@@ 4@@ th anniversary of the opening of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
last year , on the opening day of the S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i D@@ is@@ ne@@ y in China , he became the only tru@@ ck member ( that is how the company calls its employees ) who has participated in the opening of all 12 D@@ is@@ ne@@ y par@@ ks around the world .
and less than two weeks before his death , he took part in a gathering of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y f@@ ans in d@@ 23 , re@@ minis@@ cent of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
his death was reported by D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y without mentioning the reason for it .
he was 80 years old .
the S@@ k@@ lar@@ i post as ed@@ it@@ or of The D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws was temporary , but she returned after D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land after U@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . in 195@@ 6 to work on its advertising depart@@ ment .
he soon became the main shadow author of W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y in writing advertising material , plu@@ mb@@ ers , speeches , slo@@ gan@@ s , representa@@ tions and brief fil@@ ms such as a piece of correspon@@ dence that helped the company obtain approval for the construction of W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ l@@ d and E@@ p@@ co@@ t in Central F@@ l@@ or@@ da .
he also cooper@@ ated with Wales and his bro@@ ther Ro@@ y on D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s annual reports .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at was rather a pe@@ l@@ ling times for a person who only joined his 30 bir@@ th@@ day and had only six or seven years since the College was completed &apos; , S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote in his auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y &apos; D@@ rea@@ m ! IT : M@@ y H@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ C@@ en@@ tur@@ y &apos; Ma@@ ter@@ ne@@ y May@@ c K@@ dom@@ s &apos; ( 2013 ) .
however , despite his confidence in S@@ k@@ lar@@ i in the W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , he appointed the S@@ k@@ lar@@ i pa@@ vi@@ lion in New York in 196@@ 4 , where D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y sha@@ ped ex@@ hibi@@ tions and mis@@ si@@ veness .
S@@ k@@ el@@ r wrote to W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y for the M@@ ed@@ on pa@@ vi@@ et Ma@@ gi@@ c sk@@ y@@ wa@@ y , where you saw anim@@ at@@ ro@@ on@@ ic de@@ signs and co@@ op@@ ers , and which was their main connection with large corporate spon@@ sors .
this was the start of the second S@@ k@@ lar@@ i intervention in the company .
as a member of ever-increasing importance and leader of I@@ mag@@ ine@@ ers , he was increasingly involved in W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , who died at the end of 196@@ 6 for a long time before W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ l@@ d opened in 197@@ 1 and E@@ p@@ co in 198@@ 2 .
after he died due to l@@ ung cancer at the 6@@ 5-@@ year old W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , S@@ k@@ la@@ r was rec@@ eding into the world of writing when he was told that the company &apos;s leading workers had not prepared public speech , although &apos; it was not secret that the W@@ al@@ t was dying &apos; , as he would write in his auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y .
S@@ k@@ el@@ r felt frustra@@ ted , as he said , that he had to sign a statement to which Ro@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y was signing , but he realised that the lack of planning was a sign that W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s death had been paraly@@ sed by the company &apos;s leaders .
&apos;@@ In reality , they were all afraid of death &apos; , S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote .
Mr S@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ r was born in February in New B@@ run@@ s@@ w@@ ick in New J@@ er@@ se@@ y .
his father , Le@@ on , was a teacher and mother , a ne@@ i@@ u@@ s@@ da@@ r L@@ il@@ y@@ n F@@ u@@ ch@@ s , worked at J@@ oh@@ n@@ son &amp; J@@ oh@@ n@@ son , before L@@ ong Be@@ ac@@ h@@ le was in a family wal@@ king to C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , when Mar@@ ty was 12 .
after secondary school , she had a number of temporary jobs , for example she worked in D@@ ou@@ g@@ l@@ as Air@@ cra@@ ft , an ic@@ e-@@ shir@@ t ser@@ v@@ ant of H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g@@ eri@@ an d@@ rest@@ or@@ an , she served as a be@@ ac@@ on for postal services .
however , in May 195@@ 5 , when his third year in U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . was coming to an end , S@@ k@@ la@@ r received the message that she would call the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y marketing and advertising leader E@@ . Car@@ d@@ on W@@ al@@ ker .
at the time , S@@ k@@ el@@ r U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . was the new chief ed@@ it@@ or of The Da@@ ily B@@ ru@@ in .
W@@ al@@ ker asked him to come to a job inter@@ view for the creat@@ or and ed@@ it@@ orial of The D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land Ne@@ ws .
W@@ al@@ ker said that the subject par@@ k will be opened shortly .
and that needs him .
W@@ al@@ ker asked for an inter@@ view after 20 minutes .
S@@ k@@ el@@ r , however , had to prove to W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y that he knows what he is doing .
&apos;@@ M@@ y had worked there for two weeks , and I had to propose a le@@ af@@ let to W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos; , he recalled on the website of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ u@@ e .
&apos;@@ I@@ f he did not like that , he would have ex@@ tra@@ di@@ ted me from the door and employed a professional .
fortunately , however , this enjoyed Wales .
I was 21 .
it was frigh@@ tening .
I never had worked on a professional level &apos; .
the lessons of S@@ k@@ el@@ r in W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y ( and also some other people ) at one point for a &apos; M@@ ik@@ h T@@ r@@ ust &apos; , or a thematic par@@ k as a manifes@@ to of the G@@ over@@ ning Board .
the calls include , for example , the following : have a sense of purpose .
as an attempt to &apos; go to the visitors &apos; sho@@ es &apos; in order to experience the at@@ tain@@ ment that they have .
there is only one story at once in the case of the Ju@@ da@@ e@@ ta .
in writing . - Bo@@ b R@@ og@@ ers , an E@@ mer@@ gency Dis@@ ability expert , called S@@ k@@ lar@@ i once a &apos; sor@@ ce@@ rer &apos;s app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p &apos; - a role played by M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ir in D@@ is@@ ne@@ y &apos;s film &apos; fan@@ tas@@ y &apos; ( 19@@ 40 ) - because he had bro@@ ke@@ red the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y philosophy to three generations of de@@ signs .
S@@ k@@ lar@@ i is left behind by her hus@@ band , a ne@@ i@@ u@@ s@@ lan@@ der , Le@@ a@@ h Ger@@ ber , da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter L@@ es@@ li@@ e S@@ k@@ la@@ r , son Ho@@ w@@ ard and four grand@@ grand@@ children .
S@@ k@@ el@@ r was a committed leader of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
he regularly carried three target pla@@ ti@@ tu@@ des M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ire ( which showed him the time in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , Paris and T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o ) and M@@ ik@@ i-@@ Hi@@ ire &apos;s gol@@ den c@@ hu@@ r .
and he never forgotten anything he had taught him by W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
when D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Com@@ pan@@ y developed a C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia Ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ e par@@ k , S@@ k@@ la@@ r reminded the plan@@ ners that they would include activities that parents and children could do together , as W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had demanded .
&apos;@@ I reminded everyone that D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land existed at all because Wales had the ha@@ bit of taking its da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters Di@@ n@@ es and S@@ har@@ on G@@ ri@@ ff@@ it@@ i par@@ k to drive a ca@@ rou@@ sel@@ s &apos; , said to the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine The L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les in 2002 , &apos; and the bo@@ g had to sit down at a par@@ k , and children had to wal@@ k their fin@@ s and their fin@@ gers alone , to drive the p@@ ound . this is what we are doing .
he thought he had had a great deal of hu@@ m@@ our from his colleague .
but why were his symp@@ toms so different ?
at the Th@@ u@@ ma@@ point , he was given a large do@@ se at@@ ta@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ en to reduce the fe@@ ver .
for the rest of the day he was questioned , tor@@ n up , sor@@ ted and studied .
none of the tests demonstrated anything , but they were not meant to be sent home .
he understood the reason .
for the past two years , he had taken a medicine called an e@@ than@@ ol to treat S@@ j@@ ö@@ g@@ ren@@ i sy@@ nd@@ ro@@ me .
the medicine reduces the capacity of the immun@@ e system and limited its ability to combat infection .
S@@ j@@ ö@@ gre@@ n is a fre@@ e@@ z@@ er dis@@ order - a rather secre@@ tive illness in which the body &apos;s own white water fil@@ ls attack normal spo@@ ts , as if it were an in@@ trus@@ ive body that so@@ w chaos in this case , which produces te@@ ars and dep@@ ths , as well as in some of the species .
wee@@ kly e@@ than@@ ol programmes had been helpful in reducing excessive pain .
but he knew that , because of this medicine , he was quite hel@@ ple@@ ss in a serious infection .
when the at@@ se@@ min@@ o@@ fe@@ en started to work , the patient felt much better .
doctors at a cross@@ roads decided to leave him at night to hospital .
when it comes to the virus , such as doctors &apos; suspects , everything will be fine with him the next day and he will be left home .
when G@@ ir@@ ard first heard of his new patient , he famili@@ ar@@ ised himself with infection measures to which those who ad@@ minister an e@@ than@@ ol are sus@@ cep@@ tible .
the list was a long one .
the latter cannot be treated before the diagnosis , which is why it focused on pa@@ ci@@ fication of the bac@@ teri@@ a .
one bac@@ teri@@ um which attacks people with immunity is an additional food addi@@ tive .
this is often found in pas@@ te@@ ö@@ ri@@ sed milk and in che@@ ese , and it causes terrible de@@ stitu@@ tion , o@@ x@@ y@@ gen and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea which it did not have .
the pa@@ ter@@ nal disease is another infection which has spread among those who take this medicine , but it did not have the noise and the lack of air .
an even more widespread bac@@ teri@@ um Sta@@ p@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ us au@@ re@@ us may cause excess fe@@ eds but , again , it did not have excessive complaints .
nevertheless , the doctor plans to introduce large-scale antibio@@ tic treatment that would cover all these risks .
however , the patient did not feel bo@@ the@@ red to have a serious infection .
doctors at Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ point had not given him antibiotics .
the doctor had the option of delaying the administration of antibiotics and simply watching and waiting , but if the patient had one of the infection that he had read , the treatment would have been fatal by even a few hours .
the situation was made even more complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was aller@@ gic to a pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , although he did not remember what happened when he accepted it .
this created a relationship of risk and benefit .
the decision , which has traditionally low levels of investment , as to whether or not to undertake antibio@@ tic treatment , will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked a colleague , a second residence , to evaluate the patient .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard did not tell my colleague that he was going to take antibio@@ tic treatment ; he simply asked for a patient to be reviewed and to make a recommendation .
my colleague met the patient and agreed .
although he saw well , he would be virtually defence@@ less when he was inva@@ ded .
the doctor should give the patient antibiotics .
as there has been an aller@@ gy in the patient &apos;s pension scheme , G@@ ir@@ ard should be allowed to test him in order to check whether he is tole@@ rating a medicine that is not a pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin but a close relatives of it .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard asked for a recommendation to be made .
if he had had a serious reaction to the medicine , he would have had a blow or his blood pressure reduced .
neither happened .
that is why he was sum@@ med up as a whole .
a few hours later , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard made a speech .
the patient &apos;s body temperature had risen by 39 degrees .
he was quick to look at the patient .
the patient &apos;s face was s@@ co@@ red by the a@@ th@@ le@@ te , and his fields were Roma .
although he seemed un@@ comfortable , his heart and blood were all well with his blood .
the doctor than@@ ked the ad@@ vis@@ ability that he had given antibiotics to the patient .
he asked for another do@@ se of do@@ g , T@@ y@@ len@@ oli , and when his patient had to be looked at for the last time , he s@@ ma@@ cks deeply .
the fe@@ ver was re@@ treat .
H@@ ig@@ ine gold and ro@@ s@@ és had disappeared .
the first thing he did next evening , when G@@ ir@@ ard was visiting the patient for an night shift from a hospital to a hospital woman .
he had received five other patients too , but this patient was most concerned at home by G@@ ir@@ ard after being handed over to his daily team .
during the hours he had not seen , his bloody body had grown in the labor@@ atory .
it was too early to say what exactly that is .
it was clear , however , that this is a bac@@ teri@@ a that is strong enough to allow Pet@@ r@@ i to grow quickly and that it is not Sta@@ p@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ us au@@ re@@ us or a mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e disease .
the list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit .
it took another two days before they could at last identify the bac@@ teri@@ um .
it was a top@@ -@@ down .
G@@ ir@@ ard , like everyone else who looked after the patient , was surprised .
as a doctor , images of diseases come into their head .
for G@@ ir@@ ar@@ d , an additional p@@ hil@@ os@@ op@@ her was a disease deri@@ ving from un@@ f@@ et@@ te@@ red milk and soft che@@ ese , which causes a@@ ci@@ di@@ fication , o@@ x@@ y@@ gen and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ sis .
he worked through even more material on this unusual infection and found that , although people with a normal immun@@ e system could experience these symp@@ toms , they usually recover quickly like a patient colleague .
however , in the case of pregnant women , people aged 65 and those with damaged immun@@ e systems , an infection may be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed outside the se@@ ed w@@ ire - sometimes without the usual symp@@ toms appe@@ aring - and end up in the blood .
it can spread across a whole body such as the cost .
this type of infection , which is called an in@@ va@@ sive additional lo@@ t@@ tery , may result in death by up to 30 % of patients suffering it .
indeed , although it is not as widespread as the bo@@ il shoo@@ t , the lo@@ t@@ tery may be equally dead@@ ly .
early antibio@@ tic treatment can save life .
if there is a food@@ -@@ trans@@ mitted disease , what food did the bac@@ teri@@ a bear ?
although the patient and his colleague had not consumed un@@ f@@ et@@ te@@ red milk or soft che@@ ese on a journey , online se@@ arch@@ es identified an outbreak in Scotland this summer linked to a smo@@ ke@@ -free beef .
neither of them had ea@@ ten beef smo@@ ke@@ -free , but they fought a slightly smo@@ ke@@ -free divide .
where they pic@@ ked the bac@@ teri@@ um right remained a secret .
once the medical team had learnt what the patient was wrong , they were able to adjust antibiotics .
his three-@@ week treatment ended in July .
doctors advised him to finish cal@@ mly in the summer , but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the mu@@ se@@ um and his bel@@ o@@ ved work .
no shel@@ ter will be found in India , where Pakistan &apos;s price is concerned .
70 years after the greatest population in the history of two countries starting with parti@@ tion , the prices are still moving from Pakistan to India .
tens of thousands of people are already waiting in ro@@ ck camps along the borders of two countries , who do not even have the legal right to work in India .
so many have no choice but to illegally ra@@ ck down in temporary habi@@ ta@@ ts - the Indian authorities are watching very closely the movements of those who cross the border on the other side of the border .
the majority of the arri@@ vals in Pakistan cannot expect such reception .
there is no work , there is no house , there is no money , there is no fault .
there we worked in fields ; we were pe@@ as@@ ants .
here , however , we are being forced to break up the b@@ ric@@ k in order to earn a living , saying 8@@ 1-@@ year-old J@@ og@@ as .
for us , division is not over .
the prices are still trying to return to their country .
and when they come here , they have nothing &apos; , an elderly man living in a foreign camp near the town of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ k@@ ra@@ k added .
after India gained independence from British colonial rule in 19@@ 47 , over 15 million people lost their homes .
parti@@ tion caused months of violence , in which at least one million people lost their lives due to religious hatred .
in the midst of the bloody chaos , the brea@@ thing and straight from the newly formed Pakistan , the Muslims moving in the opposite direction .
despite emig@@ ration , Pakistan is still regarded as one of the most numerous minority groups in the country .
according to various estimates , they account for around 1.@@ 6 % of the country &apos;s population of 200 million .
many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear of rob@@ ber@@ y , rape and forced marriages .
&apos;@@ The persecution soon began after parti@@ tion &apos; , said J@@ og@@ d@@ as , whose family moved only a few months before the two countries de@@ par@@ ted from d@@ rou@@ ghts to the areas of the current Pakistan .
not a day ago , when we could have lived in peace .
I wanted to come back to live in the midst of my price increases .
the national government of the Indian Prime Minister , N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra , has said that it wants to make it easier to find asylum in India , persecuted for religious reasons .
last year , the government started enabling immigrants to obtain citizenship at their place of residence , in the past , through central government .
in the marks surrounding Pakistan in India , after seven years of residence , the possibility of acqu@@ iring fast-@@ start citizenship is open .
however , due to bureaucratic delays , this process is often much more time-@@ consuming .
6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ ar@@ j@@ i left Pakistan in 1997 and obtained Indian citizenship in 2005 .
according to him , however , many have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not looking for a good life in India .
the government offers no support .
we are like cattle without property .
we are simply trying to survive on our own &apos; , saying K@@ han@@ ar@@ j@@ i .
but worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities .
those who do not have citizenship have to suffer harassment from intelligence agencies .
they are regularly treated as suspects and Pakistani agents &apos; , he explained .
S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ al , based on a ch@@ ari@@ table organisation dedicated to helping prices from Pakistan , had high expectations of the motto that came to power in 2014 , but now he has had to dece@@ ive .
the tension between India and Pakistan has increased under the Mo@@ d government , with migrants suffering the most .

for many , however , this treatment is even better than it is in Pakistan .
K@@ ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i fled to India two adult bo@@ ys two years ago because she had started to obtain death threats from her P@@ ak@@ istan@@ is neighbours .
&apos;@@ in order to save our lives , we had to fle@@ e to India &apos; , said 6@@ 5-@@ year-old K@@ ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i , whose grand@@ parents had come from the current areas of India , but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country broke .
my grand@@ father went to the other side because of the work .
but he told us that we would move to India at the right moment because he knew that the future would be dangerous for prices .

the revenue from the sale of steel goes to support such an over-@@ protection project .
on the ti@@ ger day last week , more than EUR 1 000 was collected for ch@@ ari@@ table sales .
J@@ ü@@ r@@ i K@@ ol@@ k : P@@ u@@ ha@@ ke over a year , so there is no need for leave .
of course , I was personally guilty of not taking up this leave .
I was also a somewhat necessary worker , but at the same time I think the only one who considered himself indispensable .
it was to blame that I had a l@@ ol@@ la@@ h sense of duty spread in my front .
the quo@@ tation at the beginning of this Chamber is fine in that it is absolutely true .
that was the case : the new agency , which I started in March of the same year , did require a lot of work , but something that fit me so much better that I was eating a completely new life in three months .
we are in a period of summer , of holiday .
it is time to make new annual promises , to review what has happened in life and in which direction the whole thing is pul@@ ling .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you have the strength and the change of year , &apos; H@@ ind@@ ing some decent citizens off the hoo@@ k &apos; .
perhaps it is , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas is not appropriate for thinking about life and for setting targets .
well , I am speaking only for myself : I cannot make any change at the annual change .
this is too difficult a time for me .
of course , at the Christmas time , there is happ@@ iness and jo@@ y in the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th : I like knowledge of the beg@@ in@@ nings of the light , ple@@ asing the Christmas tre@@ asu@@ res , and J@@ es@@ us , too , was very much like a sy@@ m@@ per@@ tic approach , revolu@@ tionary .
nevertheless , during Christmas , I am mostly very ti@@ red and sometimes also stressed - for the sake of this bl@@ ind@@ ness .
yes , I do a great deal of work , perhaps more than I would do in a m@@ am@@ mo@@ th slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and I have been constantly pretty clear .
for the most part , I have run as I did before Christmas - gi@@ f@@ ts , at least four Christmas times , a slightly greater burden at work ...
if we also take into account the un@@ ce@@ asing social pressure to feel un@@ condi@@ tionally jo@@ y and peace at the heart , the difficulties of the Christmas period are obvious .
however , a desperate and ti@@ red person cannot make good decisions , let alone improve them as a plan for improvement .
these things still need to be done in more or less clear terms .
a ti@@ red person will perhaps throw an empty and res@@ ounding promise , which will help to lay the foundations of the future about as much as the purchase of a lo@@ t@@ tery ticket .
the promise that is intended to change something should be considered cal@@ mly , which should be beneficial ; it should be a plan .
the plan , in contrast to the promise , contains not only an objective but also a code of conduct , and does not go a few small set@@ backs after the pla@@ gue .
that is why I would say that the best time to deliver on promises is now , in the summer .
it is just a matter of cal@@ mly pu@@ mp@@ ing out and of ha@@ cking why it is so great ( if it is ) .
if you do not force yourself to sound like a ra@@ id during the holiday , a couple of weeks will be enough to find a few places of your life that deserve si@@ ck@@ ening , and to find out how exactly that can be done .
I think it is important to live as possible in such a way that there is no need for leave to rest on an ongoing basis , not once a year .
so that leave would be an additional bon@@ us , not a stop@@ -@@ gap for survival in which you are par@@ ked so much as to be able to with@@ stand any way next year .
I would suggest to everyone that there is at least one simple promise - if you have to rise up at a fixed time next morning , you have to s@@ lee@@ p in good time at night .
I believe that if one in ten Po@@ sti@@ man listened to my suggestion , life in Estonia would be significantly improved .
I myself intend to follow my own advice .
such attempts are s@@ pur@@ red by people .
it would be very good to think ahead and draw conclusions .
the recommendation to spend a little more time looking at the gu@@ n of the willing is obvious .
more generally , however , everyone could have a strategy that they share in the social media .
at national level , however , the question must be asked as to whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers threatening the social media .
the life expectancy of bo@@ gu@@ s created under controlled circumstances ended with summer school , but the bo@@ at@@ lo@@ ads certainly did not .
the fourth Est@@ onian person got heart in Finland .
in writing . - ( PT ) Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the coverage of the northern Est@@ onian Re@@ gi@@ on@@ al hospital ( P@@ ER@@ H ) doctors , Car@@ di@@ o@@ k@@ on@@ ter T@@ al@@ is and Car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist , P@@ en@@ t@@ t k@@ al@@ d@@ ra , who took part in this paragraph , the post-@@ operation period has been calculated as waiting .
&apos;@@ It is very difficult to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart &apos; spoke Hol@@ iness .
doctors claim that they have been living with a heart pu@@ mp in the world for a maximum of eight years now .
the man himself is still reco@@ vering and is not prepared to talk about this .
he was first diagno@@ sed with a lack of heart , two years ago , and the disease had already entered the final stage , and heart was caused by an Islam@@ ist war .
&apos;@@ F@@ or this illness , transplantation was the only option &apos; , added to Thailand .
according to Kar@@ di@@ k@@ er@@ o , after a transplant , the patient no longer has any wind@@ o@@ ws accompanying the heart pu@@ mp@@ s or instructions .
it has only the army and the ro@@ gue sup@@ pressing immunity left to it .
a patient could carry on sport and generally re@@ produce like a normal person &apos; , he said .
the first year is the most dangerous .
the sun@@ der added that a full recovery would take three to six months .
according to both doctors , the patient must strictly monitor the up@@ take of the gras@@ s on a regular basis , while the medicines have side effects .
in addition , the patient must carry out checks in order to avoid a kne@@ e-@@ j@@ er@@ k reaction from the donor community .
the most dangerous year is the first , but over a decade , according to IS@@ H@@ L@@ T , or the International Soci@@ ety for H@@ ear@@ t and L@@ un@@ g Trans@@ plant , over 50 % of patients live .
Thailand stated that Hel@@ sin@@ ki has better results and that the long@@ est living has been with a trans@@ plan@@ ted heart for 25 years .
the Kar@@ di@@ o@@ k@@ er@@ g explained that , because the illness caused the patient &apos;s blood b@@ reat@@ h to be poor , a heart pu@@ mp was put on him a year ago that helped to recover for the operation .
when man &apos;s l@@ ung ar@@ tery fell , he became an appropriate candidate for transplantation .
the si@@ ting operation is not regarded as a very complicated trap by the T@@ ari@@ an &apos;s esti@@ mation : the correct timing is very important .
&apos;@@ a lot more time took to get into the w@@ ool and then get to the heart when you put a new heart in &apos; , he said .
in addition , the po@@ di@@ um sur@@ ge@@ on revealed , as a complex part of the operation , that it could be cru@@ el@@ ly removed .
rather , according to him , a heart shift can be considered extraordinary , because that is what the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans need least of all .
there are far more kid@@ ne@@ y , li@@ ver and l@@ ung transplants .
there is still an ex@@ ci@@ tement about what is going to happen , but we have been ac@@ custom@@ ing this work for many years .
learning to know one@@ self and their ner@@ v@@ ous system is one art at the office &apos; , adding Thailand .
the body needs another four people .
the patient claimed to have had a heart because no other patient in a country that is part of the S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ lus link was a body that was not fit .
S@@ car@@ di@@ at@@ tri@@ an is an organ@@ iz@@ ation with members from Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia .
there are now four more people in Estonia on the heart transplants list .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is , after all , nu@@ m@@ be@@ red patients &apos; , emphasised the Hol@@ y L@@ and .
for the long@@ est time , in the TV , there are large men with a car@@ b@@ on-@@ positive boo@@ m .
&apos;@@ Finland has a qu@@ e@@ ue for this for around half a year &apos; , he said .
there are also a lot of conditions for heart .
&apos;@@ O@@ p@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties do not suit a woman &apos;s heart , the heart of a great human being small and so on &apos; , attra@@ cted a po@@ di@@ o@@ k@@ on@@ er .
there is no need to look at a good ferti@@ lise@@ r by far - between 7 and 12 August , the consumer will be in the central town , directly at the wh@@ i@@ p , the film f@@ esti@@ val t@@ AR@@ Tu@@ F@@ F .
a particular feature is its focus on love fil@@ ms .
the programme also contains fil@@ ms that represent the dar@@ kest side of love , see both new urban works and the old good clas@@ s@@ rooms .
numerous special events in many places make a week out of the university city as a film .
all fil@@ ms are free of visit , there are up to 1 500 seats , and this year an area covered with an artificial bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ery will be directly outside the scre@@ en , thereby temporarily creating a fer@@ ry for the city &apos;s central squ@@ are .
in Switzerland , the largest ferti@@ lise@@ r in Europe , 8 000 visitors can enjoy the film at the same time .
the heart of the Lo@@ car@@ no film f@@ esti@@ val will be the S@@ qu@@ are of Pi@@ az@@ za G@@ ran@@ de , or Great S@@ qu@@ are , from 2 to 12 August .
during the f@@ esti@@ val , a number of representa@@ tions are taking place , chaired by recognised ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ators and sub@@ contractors .
when an accident arri@@ ves , a short@@ fall of between EUR 15 and 20 will have to be ba@@ iled out for the benefit of one film .

for the first time , an out@@ mo@@ ded Ro@@ om@@ et@@ -@@ day building was set up in 195@@ 3 , making the P@@ ul@@ a film f@@ esti@@ val one of the oldest ferti@@ li@@ sers in Europe .
under the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter , the good fil@@ ms have been enjoyed by Richard Bur@@ ton and E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ta@@ yl@@ or , John Mal@@ ko@@ vi@@ ch and Ben K@@ ing@@ s@@ ley .
the price is symbolic : the night in the Mediterranean Ba@@ sin , with high-quality fil@@ ms , means an expense of about EUR 3 .

the ticket price also includes an open-@@ air group just before the film that is permitted to enjoy next to its long journey .
anyone who does not want to sit down or has forgotten to have a long way down will be able to b@@ orrow a be@@ dro@@ om for three euro .

a real no@@ stal@@ gic Italian sou@@ l will be experienced in the middle of Bologna , where the summer din@@ ner shows the cu@@ mb@@ ers reco@@ vered by the local film arch@@ ive .
the old fil@@ ms have to look at 3 000 to 5 000 people , alongside the ten@@ th largest church in the world , the San Pet@@ ron@@ i@@ o base .
mainly the Nor@@ th-@@ Italian buildings of the 15@@ th century en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , with summer night war@@ fare and good com@@ passion , are creating a ro@@ man@@ tic atmosphere in which every stone is mel@@ ting the north .
from 19 June to 15 August , there is a new film in front of the audi@@ ence every evening , and all this free of charge .
the Bologna p@@ hil@@ os@@ op@@ her f@@ esti@@ val , under &apos; c@@ in@@ em@@ a sta@@ rs &apos; .
the film f@@ esti@@ val of the Vi@@ ini M@@ ine R@@ emo@@ tion , Austria

5 000 free seats will be completed from 30 June to 3 September every evening , just like a mira@@ cul@@ ous one .
apart from the classi@@ c music sta@@ rs - the P@@ la@@ ci@@ do D@@ om@@ ing@@ o and the Vienna F@@ il@@ harmon@@ i@@ e groups - offers f@@ esti@@ val pic@@ ked in the morning j@@ ung@@ le .
a special feature of the film u@@ ps in Vienna is the love of good food - in addition to worl@@ d-@@ class music , you can enjoy the ro@@ ses of the best resta@@ ur@@ ants .
every day , from 11 to mid@@ night , there is an open food and drinking area that offers traditional Austrian flav@@ ours , as well as s@@ kin@@ s from Asia , Greece , Italy , Mexico and India .
comparison of the fas@@ test s@@ pa@@ th@@ ways : from the Ö@@ ö@@ club &apos;s tic@@ kets to sa@@ un@@ ari@@ th@@ ms .
the consumer ed@@ it@@ orial compared the more favourable packages offered by s@@ qu@@ a@@ res to one person for a night from 1@@ 1-@@ 12 August .
&apos;@@ S@@ pa@@ a@@ ho@@ tel is at different levels and different choice of services , so one comparison only on the basis of price is very difficult &apos; , spoke of Mario Sa@@ u , the head of sale in the C@@ IS .
compared with s@@ pa@@ th@@ ological accommodation , it turns out that prices for the most favourable packages vary several times and that options are to be found for both a more demanding custom@@ er and a more modest wish for a bu@@ ff@@ er .
for example , if a passenger is able to spend EUR 51 in a single local room of V@@ ä@@ r@@ ska S@@ pa , in a single seat of the water centre , bu@@ ff@@ et@@ -@@ din@@ ner and break@@ fast , and in un@@ restricted use of the water par@@ k , the power force and the floor , then when visiting the concept of the P@@ ä@@ n@@ es operating in Mu@@ hu@@ land , the cost to one person of the package will be EUR 2@@ 87 .
it contains accommodation in the category of D@@ ou@@ ble D@@ el@@ il@@ x , the resta@@ ur@@ ant of break@@ fast in the tal@@ ent of Alexander , and the &apos; load and irri@@ gation &apos; co@@ ff@@ e@@ e package from one and a half days .
when op@@ ting for and compared with different packages , it should be taken into account that , in order to have the best price , the holiday should be taken with a friend or com@@ passion , because double me@@ als are more advantageous than taking a single farm .
if , however , there is a desire to rest on its own , then double tobacco is offered to the vis@@ it@@ or according to the vis@@ it@@ or &apos;s seat .
if , in general , an un@@ involved passenger has to pay a few do@@ zen additional charges for staying in a two-@@ state seat alone , it will be possible to find more favourable options if compromises are made .
for example , in the Hague , F@@ R@@ A M@@ are T@@ hal@@ as@@ s@@ o S@@ p@@ as , the package will cost EUR 86 in a single local room on din@@ ner , but it will also , if it so wishes , offer a more favourable opportunity to eat in a double room on condition that someone else is accommo@@ dated in advance when there is a lack of space .
in that case , the cost of the package will be EUR 58 .
it is worth being flexible in order to obtain the most favourable di@@ ets .
package prices are dynamic , that is to say , they will depend on something that is coming from a week .
&apos;@@ F@@ or the most favourable package , the prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 &apos; , and Mr Tri@@ in@@ te@@ ra , the sales and marketing leader of Su@@ pp@@ ly in S@@ pa@@ a@@ tel@@ li , explained their pricing policy .
he , too , pointed out that in their ho@@ tels the price would be vari@@ able , depending on the per@@ former , and added that , as a rule , the custom@@ er would get the best price by boo@@ king directly to their website or asking for his own offer .
as the summer period is the qu@@ ic@@ kest for the s@@ kin@@ s , it is worth planning time for leave in order to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold .
for example , only s@@ vi@@ des have been selected on 11 August as the time of compar@@ ing the packages , both in P@@ u@@ t Hed@@ on S@@ p@@ as and in S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa and in the conference ho@@ tel , and also in Vienna in the La@@ he@@ land .
you do not need to look far for opportunities to spend a le@@ th@@ al leave : almost every larger city in Estonia finds one or so many s@@ qu@@ a@@ res .
it will be worth investigating this before the package is bought , and at the same time there will be no major event in the vic@@ in@@ ity , as this will immediately lead to prices so@@ aring .
for example , to 1@@ 1-@@ 13 August , the Hague is taking place in White .
at that time , the demand for accommodation is very high in Haiti , and we have the price of major events at the time .
&apos;@@ The@@ refor@@ e , we have no accommodation in the sale at the time at a preferential price or a favourable packaging &apos; , commen@@ ting on the s@@ pa@@ a@@ ho@@ tel wave in President I@@ ren@@ e fields .

Ka@@ ta@@ mar@@ an , yes , but there is a s@@ lip@@ per@@ y s@@ l@@ ope .
what formula should this take up with ?
let us , however , save ourselves lying ( it is not difficult to find it ) and take the view of the simple farmer of the concept of &apos; fo@@ ol@@ ing &apos; .
why do aero@@ planes stay in the air ?
the face of the w@@ ings is that , if an aircraft dri@@ ves ahead at great speed , the air that flows under the w@@ ings and over there , is creating an aero@@ dynamic increase because of the difference in terms of the pressure , at some point it exceeds the weight of the aero@@ plane and beg@@ s the whole mass of air .
in essence , the same process is taking place in error .
the right wing is creating strength to move forward at a high speed , and that in turn raises the &apos; incentive &apos; basis out of the water .
simple , surely ?
it is difficult to get to the figures .
a plane needs a minimum of between 150 and 250 kilometres per hour to take off , and the world record for drin@@ k spe@@ eds is now &apos; just &apos; 12@@ 1.@@ 1 km / h &apos; .
however , let us not get caught up in the physical fabric of secondary school .
today I have come to look at a &apos; flying &apos; direc@@ tory bearing the name NA@@ R@@ A@@ F@@ 20 Car@@ bon F@@ CS .
NA@@ C@@ R@@ A comes together with a list of head@@ lines from North and A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an Ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an As@@ soci@@ ation .
F@@ CS is a brief word from F@@ li@@ gh@@ t Con@@ tro@@ l S@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
it is a system that allows the team to settle in the middle of the &apos; flight &apos; too , and 20 show the drin@@ k &apos;s length of the j@@ ung@@ le .
as soon as the Catal@@ an is fre@@ ed from the ro@@ of@@ s , it is clear that this is not a gentle@@ man &apos;s Hol@@ y L@@ un@@ k .
Dr Mon@@ o@@ k@@ el@@ s and Cap@@ tain S@@ al@@ is remain in the ro@@ of today .
the Bi@@ ble and the g@@ las@@ ses were not on board .
that is a bon@@ us here .
that is what is going on in the P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ence of Cuba .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you give me a c@@ ool ? &apos; I ask you to give you a c@@ ool .
yes , it is all carbon .
&apos;@@ H@@ e the whole ba@@ g , then ? &apos; I do not really understand .
&apos;@@ No , the whole boat &apos; , the answer is me@@ ag@@ re .
170 k@@ it@@ che@@ n - the three of us who go on board will certainly consider more than 170 kil@@ os together .
I compare everything from was@@ hing to din@@ ner cars and I will not get around here - NA@@ C@@ R@@ A &apos;s f@@ 20 is like an un@@ suitable bre@@ ast on the street .
P@@ ag@@ an Z@@ on@@ da R or Fer@@ r@@ ari F@@ X@@ X .
built with one specific objective - to drive well , well and well quickly under controlled conditions .
the dis@@ lo@@ ving ho@@ b@@ by sol@@ di@@ er would also be hun@@ ted down by the amount of security that has to be carried out before going to the sea .
a water@@ tight suit , gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ as , a cap@@ tured boat , a c@@ ool , a ro@@ cket , a special ba@@ il-@@ out , a chi@@ p .
the li@@ tan@@ y has the feeling that the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen is on top of the sea and as well as the sea , could also colon@@ ise Mar@@ s@@ si .
&apos;@@ is there a high like@@ lih@@ ood of going around ? &apos; I ask a jo@@ ke .
&apos;@@ Y@@ es &apos; , there is a brief answer .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have gone a long way ? &apos; S@@ on@@ de@@ ti@@ n the surface .
it is clear that this cannot be a jo@@ ke .
I would like to confirm a safety bel@@ l .
the Si@@ h@@ to@@ sta@@ t@@ ball is also emphasised by the fact that N@@ ac@@ ra f@@ 20 F@@ CS needs a hel@@ l be@@ side the sea and a minimum of two cre@@ w members .
a maximum of three , so there is not much room for manoeuvre .
we are starting to see why this is not a Sunday squ@@ are one .
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cru@@ el@@ ty : from high@@ gra@@ ding to school .
from the indigenous national ab@@ normal to@@ w@@ ers , modern A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an k@@ it@@ che@@ n has in@@ heri@@ ted d@@ ol@@ p@@ pi@@ es and ba@@ iled meat .
the British roots have also had a great impact on the des@@ k there - for example , V@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ te , fer@@ re@@ t salt be@@ er , s@@ me@@ l@@ t for be@@ er to sa@@ h or Greek , re@@ minis@@ cent of the British Mar@@ m@@ and@@ i .
the honey is also in the p@@ ound , or in the le@@ th@@ al surrounding pi@@ g of meat , which is offered with po@@ ta@@ to@@ es and ca@@ ts , comes from the British .
there are also B@@ Q S@@ na@@ ges of UK origin , or the raw materials that the A@@ us@@ tri@@ ans mature on the g@@ ri@@ l , the British , rather gre@@ ed .
one local des@@ ser@@ t is a Pa@@ v@@ lo@@ va be@@ se@@ et@@ or@@ t , although it is also called an inven@@ tory by the new@@ -@@ na@@ ge .

H@@ one@@ y Jo@@ ys , in other words some jo@@ y , is called the hon@@ e@@ y-@@ sor@@ e Pal@@ ace .
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cop@@ y@@ n@@ ity , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alexander , and his life work , a com@@ patri@@ ot of the hom@@ eless , which is at least half a million at A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an home . / B@@ la@@ ke S@@ to@@ re@@ y , Pri@@ us C@@ rea@@ ti@@ ve Me@@ dia .
in the autumn of this year , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e will celebrate his 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
his father was a public official and his mother , M@@ ary , very much lo@@ ved food .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ er learnt a libr@@ ary at university and , as A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an young people used to do , he went to discover Europe after his studies .
in France , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e &apos;s food love was only ob@@ ses@@ sed and developed .
in London , however , he met his first hus@@ band , J@@ ama@@ ica &apos;s roots in Mon@@ t@@ y , with whom they opened a simple di@@ e@@ tary seat in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne in 196@@ 4 , The J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an Ho@@ use .
ten years later , the marriage broke out and the resta@@ ur@@ ant closed the doors .
in 197@@ 6 , he opened a resta@@ ur@@ ant for a slightly more prosperous nation , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e &apos; s R@@ es@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , which was one of the most pri@@ ced me@@ als of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne for the next 21 years .
the important resta@@ ur@@ ant in March still speaks of as the first F@@ ine d@@ int in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , which really was able to value fresh raw materials and provide seasonal food - a fact that now appears to be the a@@ ab@@ y@@ sa@@ ic truth , but it did not exist at all at the end of the last century .
after the re@@ signa@@ tion in the resta@@ ur@@ ant in 1997 , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e has focused on writing the house books , 15 of which have appeared closed .
there are productive food wri@@ ters in Estonia , but in his case , no book has been just a collection of prescri@@ ptions .
for A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an homes , different Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alex@@ and@@ er &apos;s co@@ ff@@ ers have been irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
for its life , however , it has to have a fifth dra@@ con@@ ian , a su@@ preme &apos; The C@@ oo@@ k s Com@@ pan@@ i@@ on &apos; , which is now at least half a million at A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an home .
the book first appeared in 1996 , an improved output in 2004 and the latest version in 2014 .
in my libr@@ ary , that is what makes quite a lot of room for the expression of 2004 , because there are around a thousand reci@@ pes in the wonderful book on 1@@ 12@@ 6 pages !
the latest scenario , however , is even more extensive .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alex@@ and@@ er &apos;s life work : &apos; the C@@ oo@@ k s Com@@ pan@@ i@@ on &apos; ( &apos; com@@ patri@@ ot of co@@ in &apos; ) is at least half a million at A@@ m@@ y in Australia &apos;s home .
this is a real carbon dioxide which , in addition to prescri@@ ptions , deals with the purchase and storage of different raw materials , introduces food@@ -@@ making technologies and makes recommendations for the purchase of vegetables .
foodstuffs are in a sta@@ ggering order , and there are also many cross-@@ references in the works - the education of libr@@ ary on the food wri@@ ter clearly did not run down .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e himself points out that it was this book that changed his life and gave a new direction to future affairs .
the sense of the popul@@ arity of the book that it has something to give to people led to the next large project , the vegetables , which in our circumstances are comparable to school facilities .
R@@ AS@@ M@@ US M@@ ä@@ g : the preparation has not gone as far as I saw in my mind .
&apos;@@ N@@ ot everything has been directly as I saw in my mind &apos; , talked about the training before M@@ ä@@ g .
on Friday , there are important points which show how exactly the body is .
and competition will show what we are doing here .
on this day , I believe that my preparation has been of high quality , both in this year and in previous years , so that all of this can be run normally .
something specific has not been dealt with since the champi@@ on@@ ship at 13@@ .@@ 05 of Estonia on Sunday , after the domestic champi@@ on@@ ship .
in recent weeks , training often goes too far .
I should have , and it may be very helpful , that the last week before the M@@ M@@ i-@@ was slightly easier .
physi@@ cally speaking , the days that remain at the beginning are as follows : yesterday , the tru@@ ck flo@@ at , today is taking a warming trend .
however , he does not want to go into his mental preparation : &apos; let me have my own rou@@ tine for a long time .
there is a lot of silence and peace , and I am not allowing some kind of ro@@ ck music to my e@@ ars .
I do not need to look at any motiva@@ tional vi@@ de@@ os or to read suicide books , but be here and , at that point , assess the possibility that a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have come together around the world to compare their abilities in one place .
this , in itself , is creating a special nature .
the m@@ m is , of course , one year at the top of every fri@@ vol@@ ous lea@@ gue , and M@@ ä@@ g has every previous launch , including the con@@ test in the Ty@@ an@@ squ@@ are , having tried some of the technical nu@@ ances , compared with a few competi@@ tions .
there is no longer any scope for experim@@ en@@ tation in police con@@ tests .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is simply the aim of running fast &apos; , it is talking about the M@@ ä@@ g , but it adds that , if you du@@ mp ahead and potentially the semi@@ -@@ final , you manage to save even a percentage or a couple of energy , they will definitely be in favour of the next drin@@ k .
for the first time , it is the foun@@ der of the Central Party and the ideological cornerstone of the elections .
so far , we said the Central Party and we thought of Sa@@ e@@ me@@ te or vice vers@@ a .
now the Middle East has to find its way without him .
in so doing , they also have to c@@ rush between the colour of their party , at times the criminal and embarras@@ sing past , supporters of the Sa@@ e@@ ti@@ are party and the expectations of the electorate .
the ex@@ o@@ dus of Sa@@ tes puts the Central Party in the most difficult situation in an ideological context .
on the basis of the existing political practice and ideology , you can say that they are firmly over@@ taken by the old f@@ in@@ ar@@ vi@@ k .
a number of ma@@ ps that previously have an effect as tru@@ mp@@ s may not materi@@ alise this time .
the P@@ op@@ ul@@ is@@ m@@ ik@@ a@@ t for the Central Party is not working , because Sa@@ e@@ me@@ ar can always promise more than the Prime Minister &apos;s party .
playing on the Russian card is difficult , not only because of the position of the Central Party in government , but also because here , too , we are seeing the S@@ vin@@ o@@ va electoral union sin@@ k gas .
the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter &apos;s card is already in the Sa@@ k@@ en@@ are po@@ cket as a result of the ongoing trial .
for the Central Party , the map of the people and the poor has also disappeared .
the first is its un@@ de@@ served , and the other is being ham@@ pered by coalition partners in the government .
however , one card may be even more significant .
all the last elections have confirmed that it is the parties that can formulate and implement the basic structure of the elections that are successful .
the main concep@@ tion of an al@@ ti@@ tude is precisely around the Sa@@ e@@ b .
if some political parties are supposed to brea@@ the life into a well-@@ functioning confrontation , the map of the Central party is once again lacking .
what will be left to the Middle East ?
they have a strong party appar@@ atus and a considerable resource available to them .
the noise must also be enough in the run-up to the elections .
after four years of self-@@ advertising with taxpayers &apos; money , the vast majority of tal@@ ents have now , I hope , been paid back to them .
there is still the city media in T@@ all@@ in@@ na , but the practice of party gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ la journ@@ alism is even less there .
in addition , the party has a mag@@ net of votes .
their role will this time be to bring them out of the fire , because the image of the power party is not enough to moti@@ vate voters considerably .
in ideological terms , Mr Ra@@ ta@@ s has to find his way , because the road to the sa@@ va@@ ge ended in this week .
Fa@@ ther We@@ e@@ il : a man broke in a foreign car on a train to s@@ lee@@ p .
yesterday night at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , police officers met a slightly sel@@ f@@ like challenge .
indeed , a Au@@ di ow@@ ner reported that in a tan@@ k located at Por@@ t Ar@@ tur@@ i , a stran@@ ger man has cli@@ m@@ bed into his car and left to s@@ lee@@ p .
the pat@@ rol@@ s that responded to the event found a man who , on the arrival of the law enforcement officers , pic@@ ked up as s@@ lee@@ ping .
namely , the man on his journey was ti@@ red for a moment and found his place in the back seat of an ali@@ en man &apos;s car .
&apos;@@ The man pic@@ ked the law enforcement on his own feet again &apos; , describes the Western P@@ ref@@ ec@@ k@@ on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k .
all the good , all the good !
vi@@ de@@ o : the Va@@ sil@@ ye@@ v has already created the second pen@@ al for the new club .
from Pi@@ as , the match already remained at the n@@ in@@ th minute against W@@ ro@@ c@@ ław S@@ las@@ k , but was able to g@@ rap@@ ple 20 minutes later .
in the past , there was a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the Pi@@ as@@ t season .
four minutes before the Nor@@ th@@ west P@@ assa@@ ge , the half-@@ defen@@ der passed his pen@@ sion@@ er .
the match ended with 1 : 1 fi@@ g .
there have been two items accumu@@ lating from the Pi@@ al four roun@@ ds , and the ran@@ king ran@@ ks are at its last , or 15 .
the most stu@@ p@@ id questions to ask the ba@@ r .
Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st bro@@ ke@@ res questions that they would rather not like to hear are he@@ igh@@ tened by the Bah@@ á &apos;@@ i .
which drin@@ k can you best do ?
there are indeed more ingredients in some drin@@ ks than in others , but the same skills and skills are needed to make them .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat is often interpreted by bac@@ kers as &apos; W@@ hat is the si@@ m@@ ple@@ st / fas@@ test to prepare ? &apos; , which signals that the cli@@ ent has whatever he drin@@ ks , whether or not to make it difficult for a ba@@ r .
what kind of drin@@ k do you most like to drin@@ k ?
this issue is interpreted in the same way as to which co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il would be the e@@ asi@@ est way to get away from the Bah@@ a &apos;@@ i right now .
it is not for the ba@@ r to say that , but for the custom@@ er to make the decisions themselves according to the be@@ ac@@ hes of their po@@ cket .
rather , the basic elements would wait for the question of whether there are any specific offers at present .
what good is being offered here ?
perhaps there is a genuine desire to know whether the base is differenti@@ ating with any offers from others , but that could be asked otherwise .
nor can the ba@@ r anticipate what the custom@@ er might prefer at all .
could I have a drin@@ k that would not be very swe@@ et ?
there is a same rule here that the base man does not know your tas@@ te and your preferences and , for one , it may not be for the others .
however , he is prepared to listen to what land@@ s@@ li@@ de the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e might contain .
does this drin@@ k give me a hea@@ da@@ che / shop ?
in the B@@ ar Islands , there is no media or predictable and you can promise the custom@@ er , have no hand at heart .
the police will search the Est@@ onian sun under the post card .

the Russian citizen Er@@ n@@ est G@@ am@@ mer , who sta@@ b@@ bed a foreign man in the T@@ all@@ in@@ na Ro@@ ad C@@ lu@@ b in 2010 and caused severe damage to his health , has received the list that Europe has sought the most need@@ y .
the Belgian authorities were already aware of the contamination of eggs in June .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen we knew at the beginning of June about the potential problems with the P@@ ed@@ p@@ ron@@ i@@ el &apos; , the Belgian spokes@@ person for food security said the V@@ R@@ T television channel , K@@ at@@ ri@@ en Stra@@ gi@@ er .
we immediately began an investigation , and we also talked about it for the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office , because it could have been a fraud .
from there , the investigation became secret .
we understand that people have health care issues and we are trying to respond to them &apos; , added Sta@@ gi@@ er .
the news agency A@@ F@@ P attempted in recent days to get information from the prosecu@@ tor involved , but it did nothing because the investi@@ ga@@ tive judge banned information from being published .
the Chan@@ nel has been withdrawn from the precautionary procedure in Belgium until the results of the analyses become clear .
millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from marketing in the Netherlands and Germany .
the German Minister for Agriculture , Mr Schmidt , has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to clarify the matter quickly .
&apos;@@ somebody has obviously pollu@@ ted eggs with a product that was for@@ b@@ idden in a criminal manner &apos; , Mr Schmidt told the German newspaper Bil@@ d .
according to the Est@@ onian F@@ ish@@ -@@ Food and Food Office ( V@@ TA ) , the contaminated eggs from pesticides produced in the Netherlands are probably not in Estonia .
&apos;@@ Ac@@ cor@@ ding to us , the Dutch eggs in Estonia are not &apos; , the V@@ TA spokes@@ man , Martin Al@@ tra@@ ja B@@ N@@ S , said to him .
he added that there are no other Dutch eg@@ g products produced in Estonia either .
according to the statistics agency , eggs from the Netherlands have not been imported in the last 10 years .
the most recent mention was made of mon@@ ks from the Netherlands in 2006 .
the Dutch authorities suspect that pesticides on fi@@ ron@@ age reached h@@ ens due to the Dutch company Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ria &apos;s attempt to cure the chic@@ k@@ ens affected .
reports in the Dutch and Belgian media that the substance containing the pesticide reached Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ f@@ ri@@ end@@ in through a Belgian company have not yet been confirmed .
in larger quantities , the fi@@ p@@ ron@@ i@@ as , according to the World Health Organisation , have moderate dangers and may have a negative impact on people , particularly children , kid@@ ne@@ ys , pay and ha@@ ke .
how do you keep ex@@ cited when you try to have a child ?

F@@ e@@ ther F@@ ir@@ st is ad@@ vising how to make sure that the good does not seem to be a ti@@ res@@ ome commitment .
take away that as an obligation .
this may be the case for any couple trying to get pregnant .

women often feel unable to enjoy the &apos; ordinary &apos; sex cycle at the end of the sex cycle when it is known that there will be no positive outcome .
this creates tensions in this respect , which in turn will lead to a reduction in the sex , and less sex will , of course , mean an even greater possibility of not being pregnant .
however , men feel that they must be able to &apos; speak &apos; if they are required to do so .
if you know your fer@@ tile days ahead , it will be able to support you in order to plan something ro@@ man@@ tic with more cost .
be it a special din@@ ner or just spend time together - enjoy each other !
take a fer@@ tile period into account .
from the point of view of re@@ production , there is no point at all in mi@@ xing when the ov@@ ine has been carried out , but in order to have your couple war@@ ring , try to sex after a few days in un@@ productive days .
although there is no evidence that pregnancy takes place more firmly , if a woman is or@@ g@@ as@@ y , it is still forgotten !
it should be remembered that each couple are different .
everyone can do things differently with regard to the fine game stress .
some men want to be aware of a woman &apos;s cycle , while others prefer not to know that they do not feel pres@@ su@@ ri@@ sed by &apos; demand to speak &apos; .
no one knows better than you how best you are .
find your own solution .
studies have shown that the highest rate of success is for couples who intera@@ ct every few days , but not every few are able to maintain this den@@ sity .
the most important thing is to find a pat@@ tern that su@@ its you best as a couple .
10 under@@ ground advertising lines which make the appearance of food more attractive .
since it is difficult to squ@@ an@@ der many foods , the picture uses a very different ingredi@@ ent which dece@@ ives people - like li@@ tre or po@@ ta@@ to@@ es instead of milk .
Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be channel , will report which tri@@ cks are fairly widespread in the advertising world .
if someone opens a po@@ p@@ cor@@ ni@@ a@@ k in advertising or pic@@ ks a h@@ amb@@ ur@@ ger out of a box , a lot of sa@@ va@@ ge will emerge from it .
the reality is that the bu@@ tter is longer and , in all its time , the heat of the food is not eva@@ por@@ ating , because the h@@ ole@@ s come from a high water content , which , for example , is not available in products .
that is why cotton bat@@ ches have been le@@ ak@@ ed into packaging or food , with the capacity to absor@@ b and keep a lot of water there .
in the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity , they h@@ ire much longer than Bur@@ ger or po@@ pp@@ y , and the product comes fresh appearance .
the po@@ ta@@ to is a great ab@@ y@@ ss for photo@@ graph@@ s , because it does not turn into a mel@@ ting po@@ t or a ther@@ mal mel@@ ting po@@ t , and it does not fundamentally change the conf@@ ig@@ u@@ ration of the like many other foodstuffs .
for example , instead of a cre@@ w or a po@@ ta@@ to@@ es or ice ice she@@ et , there can be a po@@ ta@@ to .
the od@@ d colour and dec@@ or@@ ative elements and the consumer have been be@@ a@@ ten up again .
the EU is replacing milk .
it is not easy to squ@@ an@@ der milk either , because the fo@@ g does not see it as white at all .
also , foodstuffs st@@ ow@@ ed with milk will quickly become was@@ hing inside it .
since , for example , the mor@@ te@@ m or the m@@ oud must be seen in the milk and the g@@ rub@@ b@@ ish are used instead of milk using a li@@ tre of li@@ bel that does not run through any gene@@ ro@@ sity .
if resta@@ ur@@ ants can make a great deal of effort to produce meat , so that the result is both qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m and fer@@ tile , it will not be adver@@ tised .
however , the meat that has just been presented in advertising looks particularly attractive as if it had come directly from the g@@ ri@@ l .
often , however , it is s@@ no@@ wed on the ban@@ ner or gre@@ ed and dri@@ f@@ ted into the meat with g@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ l@@ li@@ t g@@ ni@@ te tri@@ bes with sho@@ e .
it is just as difficult to work with peace as it is with ice because it ten@@ ds to mel@@ t@@ down .
fortunately , there is a product that is almost identical in scope to ru@@ in - a sol@@ di@@ er custo@@ di@@ um .
therefore , it may be in advertising on the shel@@ f or on the shel@@ f or within milk co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il .
even on the super@@ market basis of the fru@@ its on sale in the shop , there can be an a@@ erial la@@ yer which makes their appearance more s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated .
however , this is not enough for the fo@@ x , and it is a de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant that is being s@@ pra@@ yed on it to add s@@ lur@@ ry to cotton .
measu@@ rements are also not very sp@@ y@@ en@@ tine because , for a time period , they become liqu@@ ids or , for example , they release water .
here , however , we can help with the passage whose private col@@ ours and more permanent te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y make it possible to make a temp@@ ting is@@ tu@@ te .
the arrest has probably also been used on the pic@@ tures where a mel@@ t@@ down of cho@@ col@@ ate is flow@@ ing on the head of the ca@@ ke or ice crea@@ m .
if you notice a school with ideal per@@ cep@@ tions in advertising where b@@ is@@ cu@@ le was taken and the exact relationship is ideal , there are apparently some extra la@@ yers or bat@@ tles used there .
this is because you can break the ca@@ ke and up@@ set the picture .
if , after being cut down , you push in and s@@ pra@@ y pieces and s@@ pra@@ y them over the top , that makes a vis@@ ual impression .
the car@@ cas@@ ses and nit@@ ro@@ gen need@@ les are also used in the bur@@ g@@ ger to pin@@ point all the ingredients there in order to sustain them well .
that is why Bur@@ ger does not stand up as it did in advertising .
the paper was kno@@ w@@ led@@ ge@@ able chic@@ ken .
in advertising , gre@@ ed is seen as a me@@ al and an adult , but it may not even be ready for matu@@ rity .
in order to add an adult &apos;s impression , the chic@@ ken will be top@@ ped with paper , if necessary with the po@@ ta@@ to bear I mentioned earlier , and then the chic@@ ken will simply be s@@ pra@@ yed with the colour of bro@@ wn .
the P@@ ann@@ co@@ s are po@@ cke@@ ted in particular in American advertise@@ ments , because this image creates a high level of po@@ pp@@ y in people &apos;s minds .
in fact , the co@@ gs inf@@ li@@ ct into the hospital quickly , and the flow@@ ing transfer pi@@ g dis@@ appears quickly from the door to the photo@@ g@@ raph .
this is why every ban@@ ner is being s@@ pra@@ yed by means of a deter@@ rent for diesel , which helps to prevent rapid inf@@ il@@ tration .
it is often not helpful either , and so the gold bri@@ de is resor@@ ting to motor oil that is du@@ mped on the bo@@ ys &apos; s@@ co@@ res and presented as a transplant .
in the U@@ 18 cases in Estonia , the British R@@ ight and the A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ om@@ a cannot get off the hoo@@ k .
the match started at an extremely rapid pace , and the first quarter that the British won in five ( 18 : 23 ) were thrown a lot of repeating .
in the second quarter , the gap increased still further , and there was a lack of progress in terms of rest breaks , with gu@@ es@@ ts in the n@@ ine-@@ point ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia was able to win a third quarter , but with just one point .
the loss of Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans before the last 10 minutes was eigh@@ t-@@ point ( 46 : 54 ) .
Estonia &apos;s game completely broke down in the fourth quarter and , in the end , the loss had to be received with the numbers 61 : 75 .
the loss c@@ rus@@ hed the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans &apos; hopes of reaching A@@ -@@ 14 , as only two of the best collec@@ tions will be able to get there .
at tomorrow &apos;s third game , Estonia will be faced with the lo@@ ser of the game between Croatia and Israel .

he was a friend in a lea@@ f with people who introduced the bon@@ us to him and who later became his band .

one more thing : Le@@ va@@ dia broke the Pa@@ ide L@@ in@@ nam@@ ese Pro@@ te@@ m in his home field .
Le@@ va@@ dia has put itself in a difficult position because in the previous round , it was sur@@ pris@@ ingly lost on the future of Vil@@ j@@ a , and the Tam@@ il leader F@@ l@@ or@@ a made use of this opportunity by sli@@ pping into seven points .
however , on a par with the Le@@ va@@ dy , the co@@ war@@ di@@ er has reached the same stra@@ w .
the Pa@@ ide who has been imprisoned during the summer transition window with ma@@ ke@@ -up will continue to miss the cap@@ tain and the medi@@ um@@ -@@ speaking troika from And@@ re Fo@@ lo@@ v .
the last seven games have been n@@ ou@@ ris@@ hed by just two fi@@ g points , the ma@@ gic table is in the eigh@@ th place - T@@ ar@@ tu T@@ ar@@ tu , with four points , and the future in front of four points in turn .
for Le@@ va@@ dy , the first bat@@ ch in the street in the P@@ ans lost 0 : 7 and 2 : 5 .
the Central Party does not want the S@@ ik@@ e@@ are Union of election .
the leaders of the regions of the Central Party across Estonia made an appeal to the public and to their party counterparts , calling for a &apos; Central party &apos; vote , not a &apos; electoral union &apos; .

we have done a great deal for Estonia &apos;s success .
the Vice-President of the European Commission , And@@ r@@ us An@@ si@@ p , in an inter@@ view with Kroes , said that he had a sad look at Estonia &apos;s everyday policy , as the government of J@@ ü@@ r@@ r Ra@@ ta@@ s has been g@@ rap@@ pling with a simple and predictable tax system .
the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine used the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia &apos;s success and what I can be proud of .
I am delighted that we have been a good team in the government and that , in the months we read , we have made many important decisions , many of which have been awaited in Estonia for more than 10 years &apos; , wrote today in the social media .
the level says that these decisions are , for example , a tax reform for increasing people &apos;s incomes , pension reform to ensure a decent retirement for the elderly , government reform to off@@ set Estonia &apos;s development , an increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and , of course , health care for available and high-quality health care .

it is worth calculating how much sugar is in milk products ?
&apos;@@ Ac@@ cor@@ ding to EU food labelling standards , the packaging can indicate the amount of hydro@@ car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dra@@ tes and sugar , which is nothing short of white , so-called des@@ al@@ k@@ r@@ u , &apos; , confirmed by V@@ ali@@ o Est@@ onian marketing director K@@ ris@@ ta Kal@@ b@@ in .
he says that there are actually three types of sugar in dairy products : the milk la@@ c@@ to@@ l , the natural milk be@@ et , the fruit g@@ il@@ co@@ se and the f@@ ru@@ c@@ to@@ s , and an added sugar , or suc@@ rose .
however , bearing in mind a few simple basic concepts , according to Kal@@ b@@ in , it should not be difficult to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar added in the product .
first of all , it needs to be clarified whether there are milk products or modified milk products .
in the normal milk and milk drin@@ ks , there is approximately 5 grams of a natural milk co@@ w , or a la@@ c@@ to@@ se of 100 grams per product .
the milk products that have been hit have consumed part of the la@@ c@@ una during the a@@ ci@@ di@@ fication process , for example , which has resulted in an a@@ ci@@ di@@ fied dairy product for an average of 3.@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g .
&apos;@@ T@@ o calcu@@ late the amount of sugar added , the first one to calcu@@ late the sugar in the la@@ c@@ to@@ l &apos; , said Kal@@ b@@ in .
now it is necessary to calcu@@ late the f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and g@@ ly@@ co@@ ses from the quantities of sugar .
&apos;@@ generally speaking , f@@ ru@@ k@@ to@@ s and g@@ ly@@ al@@ ed milk products have a normal 3-@@ 4 % share of fruit in the normal range of 3 % and , in particular , in br@@ ands ca 15 % of crop content in products up to 1.5 grams of 100 &apos; , said Kal@@ b@@ in .
according to him , this simple calculation shows that the amount of sugar added may be up to double the amount of sugar indicated on the packaging .
in the case of be@@ e-@@ free products , the situation is slightly different , because in their case , sugar is dependent on production technology .
a 10@@ 1 year-old man ju@@ mped from a plane .
the quarter of World War II , Ver@@ du@@ n Ha@@ ys , recently received a military honour to commemor@@ ate a par@@ ac@@ id act that had broken his world record .
indeed , a man committed a 10@@ 1 year and 38 days of age in prison , thereby getting the oldest person in the world carrying out a ste@@ el@@ der cut .
in antici@@ pation of the fin@@ ishing emissions from the air : will Ger@@ d K@@ an@@ ter make the history of M@@ i ?
this m@@ am@@ mo@@ th is for K@@ an@@ ter , and none of his competi@@ tor in London has achieved that achievement .
in addition , the K@@ an@@ ter is the only he@@ re@@ tics through a history that has won a full set of honey med@@ als ( gold , two sil@@ ver and two pi@@ les ) M@@ en .
today ( from 5 August 201@@ 7 ) , K@@ an@@ ter is 38 years old and 92 days old .
if he turns himself into a double world champion , he will be the oldest po@@ ta@@ to winner M@@ il &apos;s gol@@ den me@@ al .
the Polish army , P@@ j@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ac@@ ho@@ w@@ ski@@ l ( 34 years old and 60 days old ) , have a similar opportunity .
more exc@@ iting facts :
the world champion of carbon emissions has come on more than one occasion from only two countries &apos; a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
Germany has nine gold med@@ als , Lithuania two .
the record of the World C@@ up belongs to the name of V@@ ir@@ gi@@ li@@ s A@@ le@@ na , which was ho@@ sted in Hel@@ sin@@ ki ( in 2005 ) by 7@@ 0.@@ 17 .
the lowest result won by the w@@ ings is 6@@ 6.@@ 20 - it was done by R@@ ie@@ l ( 199@@ 1 ) .
why are the do@@ gs pul@@ ling their eyes down ?
at times , it is thought that a do@@ g will eat a me@@ al if he does not know that well and wants to make a mo@@ ck@@ ery .
in fact , the majority of abun@@ dan@@ t feed do@@ gs are completely healthy .
only less than 10 % of do@@ gs who seem to b@@ end because of a few diseases .
one of the reasons why a do@@ g can suddenly start breaking down could be nutri@@ ent , poor food stocks .
those do@@ gs who have religions can also take a greater interest in appe@@ aring .
therefore , if a do@@ g that has not broken in the past has suddenly grown up in the whe@@ at and often ea@@ ten it , it is worth going to the doctor in any case , so that the potential problem of so@@ ya organs , for example , is quickly pic@@ ked up .
it is worth pointing out that a do@@ g can also be broken because it likes its tas@@ te or is simply du@@ rable .
if a health problem is ruled out , it would be worth as@@ cer@@ tain@@ ing that the family &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite will continue to be sufficiently developed and desperate .
more than 200 people were hun@@ ted down by the police during the Weber .
in total , more than 20 crimes were recorded in the town of S@@ ä@@ r@@ t in f@@ esti@@ val days .
there are grounds for linking around half of them with the use of violence to the presence of a large amount of nar@@ co@@ tic substances and two drin@@ k driving .
the mis@@ appropri@@ ation initiated by the population was mainly related to the use or possession of under@@ age or prohibited substances for alcohol .
some the@@ ft and violations of public order were recorded .
police stations brought more than 200 people to justice for a variety of reasons .
of these , one and a half were under@@ age , and mostly the reason for driving the police station was alco@@ ho@@ lic drin@@ ks .
the bu@@ b@@ ble was half as far as minors were concerned .
one and a half hundred people were taken , that is to say just as much as last year .
according to And@@ res S@@ human man , the leader of the police station , Mr S@@ man , the numbers mentioned above are waiting for a large crow@@ d .
as we have done in previous years , we have prepared thoroughly for this weekend .
we have included pri@@ f@@ ec@@ ts , police equipment and aid police officers elsewhere to ensure that we are ready to react quickly .
most situations were resolved with a word and enough of poli@@ cing with the citizens .
&apos;@@ S@@ human said that there were not many bad things because the police were in the city and , in our view , felt quite a lot &apos; , S@@ man spoke .
in his opinion , it was extremely positive that under@@ age people who had alcohol were obviously less and that young people proved to be in a position to celebrate .
he commen@@ ded the high-@@ ran@@ king team of the security company , who took care of the security of the f@@ esti@@ val area .
I would like to thank all the f@@ esti@@ val men who ap@@ prehen@@ ded themselves in a poli@@ te manner and put their brak@@ es in a safe manner .
&apos;@@ also , thank you to the local people who , with their understanding of the attitude of the great f@@ esti@@ val , contributed to the success of the great f@@ esti@@ val &apos; , was a poli@@ ce@@ man .
the Hol@@ y police station expects ow@@ ners from the city at the weekend and from the f@@ esti@@ val to have been found .
according to Mrs P@@ ä@@ n@@ ika P@@ ä@@ n@@ na , the leader of the service in the F@@ esti@@ val , who was responsible for re@@ leg@@ ating the findings , this year there had been fewer for@@ m@@ ul@@ as lost than the soil .
F@@ esti@@ val was returned to the owners on an ongoing basis over half of the sites in the police scre@@ en .
the biggest losses in three days were bank cards , identity papers , mobile phones and taking .
&apos;@@ The@@ refor@@ e , at the moment , the ow@@ ner is waiting for another 13 mobile phones , three b@@ ag@@ s , lap@@ top compu@@ ters , smart bel@@ ts and several car wri@@ ters &apos; , listed as P@@ ä@@ na .

the accident happened by the O@@ s@@ pre@@ y M@@ V@@ -@@ 22 na@@ il plane , which launched U@@ S@@ S Bon@@ d tomorrow from the R@@ ic@@ har@@ d par@@ ade .

the south-@@ west Japan is preparing for a ty@@ pho@@ on in Norway .
a large part of south-@@ west Japan , including the regions devastated by the ra@@ info@@ rests last month , was prepared on Friday for even more hatred when the ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u , one of the strongest stor@@ ms in the world , s@@ pan@@ ned ever closer to the main islands of the country .
according to the Me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Agency , from the south-@@ west Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u Is@@ land , the A@@ m@@ am@@ i arch@@ i@@ pe@@ la@@ go , approximately 13@@ 50 km from the T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , on the south of the be@@ dro@@ om , has strong wind@@ s and heavy ra@@ inf@@ all on the l@@ ings of be@@ ac@@ hes and , within the next 48 hours , it is possible that up to 800 m@@ m sa@@ dec@@ dec@@ ins .
the spokes@@ man of the Me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Agency said that Norway , which stands for certain types of fear in Korean language , would then probably turn to the north and aff@@ li@@ ct the rain over Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u , although the island &apos;s sections hit by rain and floods that killed 36 people and left four missing last month are likely to escape from the worst .
&apos;@@ This is an extremely slow storm &apos; , added , noting that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding , as there is plenty of rain in one region for a long time .
Nor@@ u , which was a Tam@@ il tariff at some point and is a rou@@ tin@@ ely long storm , first formed two weeks ago and swe@@ pt across the Pacific , before moving to nature , targeting Japan and weakening its approach .
the representative added that , depending on the change of course , Norway could go straight beyond Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and then by@@ pass the Japanese H@@ on@@ sh@@ u island , but it is still difficult to determine the long@@ er@@ -term journey .
the plane marked the perfect image of the US over itself .
the pilot led to the internal passenger aircraft over the United States and was even able to rela@@ x the route slightly .
the aircraft &apos;s re@@ al-@@ time airport data indicated that it was not just a straight line or a clo@@ th@@ es line , but an airport station that formed an aero@@ plane combined with each other .

in view of the map , an aircraft &apos;s strange route represents a passenger aircraft with two engines .
in the words of Boeing , the flight is part of an 18-@@ hour &apos; resistance &apos; test of the aircraft .
&apos;@@ instead of flying to a rand@@ om pat@@ tern , the test team put their imag@@ ination on a route made up of 22 dom@@ ici@@ led by the 7@@ 8@@ 7@@ -@@ 8 con@@ t@@ ress &apos; , said to Boeing Com@@ pan@@ y &apos;s representative R@@ T@@ .@@ com@@ .

judge L@@ ord S@@ um@@ m@@ ers called the murder &apos; particularly brutal &apos; , because in the body of the victim there were 14 tor@@ na@@ do .
a national defence lawyer , Brian Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e , said it was killed by a &apos; current ma@@ dness &apos; , but he described the facts as &apos; extraordinary &apos; .
Cas@@ si@@ y heard that F@@ ar@@ is@@ h had been sexu@@ ally abused by one woman for a long time .
his lawyer said that a man went home in F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i and &apos; friendly &apos; to him in the hope of hearing conf@@ es@@ sions , not with a plan to kill him .
L@@ ord S@@ um@@ m@@ ers stated that Cas@@ si@@ y showed signs referring to the intention on the day of the attack , and pointed to a report on social work which showed that the accused had under@@ gone special troops training in the military on how to inf@@ il@@ tra@@ te a group by friendly .
no charges had been made against F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i .
it was reported in the court that , after the murder , Cas@@ si@@ y itself conta@@ cted the police and ap@@ pealed .
Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e stated that most people have &apos; difficulties understanding &apos; that Cas@@ si@@ y is capable of murder .
the defence lawyer said : &apos; he has never had any problems in his life before this incident .
he lived as a full life until the moment of this in@@ san@@ ity in February 201@@ 6 .
Cas@@ si@@ y &apos;s health is re@@ por@@ te@@ dly poor and has been hit by heart and mouth while he is in custo@@ dy .
according to L@@ ord S@@ um@@ mer , when he sentenced a minimum 17@@ -year prison to life , he took into account that Cas@@ si@@ l did not have any past convictions , and what he allegedly said about Far@@ ish@@ i .

Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ r@@ r@@ i was today visiting the fourth largest island of Estonia in the context of a trip to small islands , V@@ or@@ m@@ i , where local leaders and residents met to discuss the current issues of the island &apos;s life .
a t@@ our of the V@@ or@@ m@@ an Is@@ land was born from the port of S@@ vi@@ by , where the Prime Minister was welcomed by the V@@ or@@ m@@ i Val@@ ley Val@@ ley in Tan@@ el for a contin@@ ental shel@@ ter , and the Chairman of the coun@@ cil , I@@ vo Sar@@ a@@ pu@@ u .
the first was a visit to the historic Church of S@@ t@@ . O@@ la@@ vi and to the de@@ lo@@ cal@@ ised fish , which is unique in Estonia in terms of its own sin@@ s and s@@ and li@@ mb@@ ers .
a study of V@@ or@@ m@@ si &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y primary school followed by the director A@@ ge H@@ ä@@ l@@ v@@ in talked to the Prime Minister about the school &apos;s life and the arrangements for school pupils to have a part of school@@ ing .
in 2015 , the Prime Minister added to a new and modern operational service in an open spirit , in addition to meeting the island population .
the debate dealt with important issues for the population , such as the development of shipping and airlines between small islands and the continent .
the country is committed to ensuring regular transport links on small farms with permanent existence , but increased traffic during the summer period , for example , also makes important journeys for local residents more difficult .
these are places where a state can take local concerns and needs into account in an early life and in planning process &apos; , Prime Minister said .
in addition , the issue of the construction of the port of small vessels , the education of interest , the island &apos;s safety and the capacity to rescue it was discussed .
today &apos;s V@@ or@@ m@@ si visit was the last part of the small island of Prime Minister &apos;s visit to famili@@ arise themselves with the island &apos;s living environment and to discuss issues that are still to be resolved with local residents and local authorities .

a woman found a stran@@ ger in a was@@ hing machine - to whom could it belong ?
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I started to withdraw the machine , when the sor@@ e was@@ hing machine between a rub@@ ber g@@ im@@ mic@@ k in my eye , a woman is talking about how she found a stran@@ ger in her was@@ hing machine .
in fact , Kar@@ in , in his first care , did not take the s@@ lur@@ ry out at the door .
I have made a machine go again .
&apos;@@ A@@ t the top of the two small children , this un@@ determined la@@ undering will immediately &apos; , s@@ lee@@ ping for the woman .
when the second was@@ hing procedure went through and I started to take out the was@@ hing out , I still found this kind of b@@ right was@@ hing machine between a rub@@ ber in my eye and then found the pu@@ ppe@@ t there .
the name of the man who was mar@@ ried 14 years ago - Tom@@ i - has been gra@@ ved as a gold fragile .
as no one knows what it is called a man or a woman who could be mar@@ ried with a few Tom@@ orrow , the friendship is complete my@@ sti@@ fying .
she studied from an old child that she might have found her cour@@ ty@@ ard , put into her po@@ cket and that the friendship had entered through her was@@ hing machine , but the child stated that she had not brought her finger home .
Kar@@ in has lived for a year in the street in T@@ all@@ in@@ n M@@ ad@@ al@@ a , with his life compli@@ city .
they were selling it out in the past , and then the was@@ hing machine also came out of the time .
but if the finger should have anything to do with the ten@@ ants , how did it get into the machine ?
&apos;@@ The@@ refor@@ e I am out of touch and cannot understand the path taken by driving a was@@ hing machine &apos; , a woman is s@@ mil@@ ing .
as the life rate on the side@@ lines of two small children is quite quick , we forget at the beginning of the clo@@ ck at home .
&apos;@@ L@@ ast time there have been postal de@@ pu@@ ties looking for the ow@@ ner of the bar@@ ring of marriage , and now it seemed that it is high time to look for the ow@@ ner of the war that he found , refers to a case in the social media in Kar@@ in which the outbreak in T@@ all@@ in@@ n was happily taken by the ow@@ ner last week .
&apos;@@ because various things are found and se@@ ar@@ ched in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , I was the first to try luck there &apos; , Kar@@ in , whose post has already been shared by nearly 4 000 people , speaks .
&apos;@@ Po@@ sti@@ tion has received any feedback and not everything is good &apos; , he is threatening the woman by indicating that his first comments were recommended to take his man on his side .
then the feeling was that it was necessary to do so .
since my man has become the biggest dece@@ it we have heard .
frankly , I was concerned about that at the beginning , but later on , when the comments came out that I , perhaps , had become sc@@ at@@ tered with a gu@@ n , it had already made a mo@@ ck@@ ery .
the co-@@ presid@@ ents also suggested that perhaps the finger had reached the other round in the po@@ cket of clo@@ th@@ es .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , most recently somewhere six months ago , one other round , purchased in order to work , flying in a was@@ hing machine without more in-depth research , but is it really ? &apos; she is discussing the M@@ Ps ?
be that as it may , we have agreed with the partner that now , in principle , we have to find the ow@@ ner of the war .
whatever the reason for the loss of the war .
divorce , family class or whatever .
I think that this is the only right thing to do , because if I ever had to lose this mar@@ ital feeling , I know that I would be most grateful to a person who would try to find me and return my valuable property .
Kar@@ in has also ap@@ pealed to the Agency for Fam@@ ili@@ es to get the support there in finding the ow@@ ner .
I had the answer , however , that Estonia had not been hel@@ ple@@ ss on that date and by a name .
one of the sis@@ ters has found the ow@@ ner .
recently , the mar@@ ital assassin@@ ation found in T@@ all@@ in@@ n P@@ el@@ gu@@ ran@@ n on 21 July , which a gra@@ ve promise to presu@@ me to be an old woman , was happily returned to the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ J@@ al@@ t the morning with the do@@ gs , and I noticed the outbreak behind 53 houses , inside inside inside the ba@@ il-@@ out , the gol@@ den sis@@ ter &apos; , Ger@@ l says that gra@@ ver allowed to assume that it was an old woman .
Ger@@ l placed a pho@@ to on the De@@ ar ( cl@@ oud ) on his F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k she@@ et and in a group &apos; marked in T@@ all@@ in@@ n &apos; , shared information with the city of North T@@ all@@ in@@ na and the P@@ ref@@ ec@@ t of the North .
in two weeks &apos; time , the police conta@@ cted Ger@@ l and reported that the High Representative had been identified .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , &apos; I had had had the ow@@ ner &apos;s da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter in contact and on Monday evening he left the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter in the sha@@ m &apos; , because the old woman had was@@ hed her hand and dri@@ ed her hand over her hand , where she had bur@@ nt down .
&apos;@@ he lost it the same day in the morning when I wal@@ ked with his do@@ g &apos; says Ger@@ l .
from time to time , the forest will have to be be@@ a@@ ten for whatever reason .
however , if there is a split between the sk@@ in , it is the right time to make a mo@@ dal drin@@ k .
there are enough resources available for this in the forest .
the home of protection will make a small ap@@ pra@@ is@@ al .
what we are talking about is a drin@@ k , because a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e contains some way , which is a virtual effect to some extent , but is not the best for our health .
plants found in free nature must always be prepared for testing , as both prescri@@ ptions and tas@@ tes differ .
some of them do not need to fly for a long time , they only need bul@@ ly water , while others have to be taken to the hour .
of course , it must also be atten@@ tive to the fact that water and plants are safe enough .
it is also very much dependent on the time and place of the year of clean@@ ing .
we will now look more closely at how to make some simple journey and what impact these can have on us .
road of migration o@@ x@@ y@@ gen
a road of migration can be a go@@ d for a year cal@@ mly .
if 2 lit@@ res of water are good a day , then that road is good to satisfy the need for C vita@@ m@@ in and , on top of that , to provide a little bit of extra energy .
just as with all plants , it is possible to get some useful elements from the games to@@ w@@ ers using alternative methods , for example by breaking them - the th@@ u@@ gs need not be bo@@ gged down with the hot water and , for some hours , not cutting .
half a li@@ tre of water takes 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res of o@@ ils , which have to be cut by 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k in which there are nearly 25 m@@ g C vita@@ m@@ in , a lot of ca@@ ali@@ um and a ta@@ m@@ me@@ tic .
in addition , the drin@@ k contains around 1.5 sugar bul@@ bs , or ca 20 k@@ ca sugar .
a ma@@ ke@@ -up can always be added to a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e and honey in order to improve tas@@ te .
and once the drin@@ k had a bear , it can d@@ il@@ u@@ te it with water like a transplant .
making the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il route is the same , but the drin@@ k itself tas@@ tes a little different .
the V@@ ar@@ tel Ro@@ ad is excellent and is helping against a great many w@@ o@@ es , from a journey to a wh@@ is@@ t@@ le of wh@@ eel@@ s .
the V@@ ar Islands is helping to overcome fa@@ ti@@ gue , has a pain@@ kil@@ ling effect and will help in the case of ref@@ rig@@ erated diseases , both as a deter@@ rent and as a de@@ lu@@ ge of the fe@@ ver .
consequently , it would not be worth more than half a li@@ tre a day .
the V@@ ar@@ ik@@ a@@ j@@ an is also time to k@@ id , so winter should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it .
to make a drin@@ k in the winter , you take fresh wh@@ al@@ es , you use co@@ ws , networks or mar@@ ches during the summer .
for half a li@@ tre of drin@@ k a little pu@@ n of par@@ ad@@ ise is needed , which has to be st@@ ole@@ n until the water has a red me@@ al .
the V@@ adi@@ c assets can also be pul@@ led out .
to do this , the shel@@ ters and keep them in warm water for a couple of hours .
longer and more in-depth work also makes the drin@@ k more stu@@ b@@ born .
a completed pi@@ g of wh@@ eel@@ s may also be added to the playing field .
a s@@ nu@@ ff cut
Mus@@ t@@ nu@@ t is a c@@ oo@@ se which , in nature , looks like a black be@@ et in the villa@@ ge of a tre@@ e .
for the most part , it is found in the bo@@ xes , but also elsewhere .
this area of use is very broad - hot drinking , fire to ar@@ son , vi@@ ral instead , etc .
ash can also be was@@ hed very well .
a cu@@ t-@@ off path is a kind of super@@ market drin@@ k that can be used to treat a great many diseases , even cancer or len@@ i@@ ency , to he@@ igh@@ ten ton@@ es , to reduce stress , to increase life expectancy .
Se@@ en contains a number of unique comp@@ ounds and a lot of vita@@ m@@ in B , as well as anti@@ o@@ the@@ sis and a little min@@ eral and protein .
the roads made from Se@@ ens can be che@@ ese every day , there is no risk of over-@@ consumption .
in order to run around 3 x 3 c@@ m will be enough in a special procedure , which will have to be offered in 2 to 3 lit@@ res with between 5 and 15 minutes .
a woman wal@@ ks around the world : my day &apos;s budget is USD 5 !
I , too , have had this experience , it is true , for 40 days , where I decided in southern France to live a &apos; mad &apos; life in order simply to be free and to live on a single day .
it had a d@@ res@@ sed tent , a wild , a small town in stations , and so on .
the second week I joined in a French &apos; hom@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness &apos; , 44 year-old men .
O@@ i , do not think that some pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an we@@ ights v@@ ars : we were just playing the same par@@ g in M@@ en@@ ton and we became friends , although he was 15@@ a parent of me , was a good business .
it turned out that a man was a good family , Paris , a former French na@@ val officer .
the Al@@ ko@@ t does not use , the sun does not , in short , a decent person , an intelligent , pleasant person to have seen life .
I joined him and followed him for 3 weeks . we were in the middle , in the city , and also in the fo@@ d@@ der for about 5 years .
the money was still coming , so long as it was alive .
the man taught how he could even@@ ly offer assistance in the steel and se@@ al@@ ed farms of closed ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ants .
we worked hard to get feed money for the next 2-@@ 3 days and then on ...
at some point I sta@@ yed with the fe@@ ver and decided that there would be no more ...
I took a flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki , home .
and , by the way , I still regret it .
those 40 days were probably the best in my life .
a recent reference was made in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : &apos; the quo@@ tation is a poor recital &apos; .
that is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done in history to re@@ produce human nature and what results have been achieved .
I do not assess whether these tests can be regarded as a success or a failure .
I also avoid excessive indications of sources , although I may d@@ well on the point made by my most important teacher , T@@ o@@ om@@ as Pa@@ au@@ l : all my thoughts are borro@@ wed from somewhere , if only remember where exactly .
the most striking ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step step step work in this Estonia is the re-@@ education of the citizen of the Republic of Estonia , a perfect person .
we do not grow him as we grow a child - in good faith that he gets a man .
we grow it as the ruling class imag@@ ines it - which one person must be allowed to live and speak out in Estonia .
censorship is perfect .
although the local ruling class changed partly a year ago , some farming methods are just as horri@@ fying as those of the previous ruling class , the now impover@@ ished address - their bru@@ tality does not bo@@ de in the least to their previous ones .
they are quite simply different .
Latvia &apos;s be@@ er is the mar@@ ch of the be@@ ating m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece of a new era .
mandatory for national leaders , 0.@@ 5 proto@@ types .
the ruling class includes not only those politicians who get paid from the state for their work , but also those self-@@ aware who freely do politics ( read : inten@@ tionally ) : write , using the image of Mi@@ h@@ el@@ t , by means of opinion fla@@ g@@ ships , by engaging in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , when the terrible people living around them in Estonia , who are de@@ v@@ ouring them , are boycot@@ ting , campaig@@ ning , v@@ and@@ o@@ ising , sa@@ b@@ o@@ tag@@ ed .
they are only willing to be in EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber ( the English language about people living in a room where there are only suitable opinions for them , such as their own F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k friends , etc . ) , but this is not possible in the conflict in Estonia .
there are still some compli@@ cations who think or do something that is un@@ be@@ arable for the hi@@ ja@@ co@@ di@@ um .
and there is the war of words un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ling and business can@@ n@@ ons are my@@ sti@@ fying .
we have a number of politicians who know exactly how many people can s@@ lee@@ p with , many children to make a job , a lot of pay , how to rest , what to eat , how to dis@@ solve , when you are ill , how you die .
very important places .
if there is anything else that these public speeches say that they are ob@@ scene , off@@ ended in hy@@ ste@@ ria .
the fact that people in a number of European countries are driving with a &apos; full head &apos; , and that is permitted by the law , does not undermine their opinions .
zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every area , but behind zero tolerance is not caring , but it is a sca@@ pe@@ go@@ at .
class hatred and f@@ at@@ ty - only those like me sound .
the P@@ y@@ rene@@ tic politicians can open only mouth , but never mind .
they believe that every &apos; measure with which they improve society works and is worthy of the test .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we have a k@@ it@@ che@@ n , a k@@ it@@ che@@ n of sufficient size , a k@@ it@@ che@@ n with mental disabilities , who ju@@ mp through every window - without knowing the pain .
it therefore seems to us that , if a cle@@ ver pe@@ as@@ ant opens his mouth and is be@@ a@@ ten for it in a few quarters for an emotional error , that is reasonable .
a few words that will certainly bring us into the space of one winter are , for example , tomorrow , a refugee , a woman , violence , work and so on .
if you believe everything that self-@@ serving officials , activists and politicians ( only a small part of all groups , but they can kidna@@ p in such a way that the whole of society is sad@@ den@@ ed ) talk and wri@@ t@@ ings , the citizen is not only dis@@ gus@@ ting , ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant and un@@ pleasant , but also un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
but do not believe , do not coer@@ ce , do not prohibit drinking .
the Est@@ onian person , in any case , drin@@ ks as much as he wants , and not as much as the state allows .
the Est@@ onian person will , in any case , tolerate more if he is not forced to tolerate .
the Est@@ onian person will not change his behaviour two months before the elections so that , if they achieve the objective , they will not only turn their backs on the popul@@ arity diet and then have their feet again , but will also drive out what will quickly restore the un@@ pleasant brain drain .
who does it differently is not the right way to go .
I do not believe that a single person can be reco@@ vered .
I believe that one can teach a person .
to drin@@ k sensi@@ bly , to love my family , to be a hard-@@ working , poli@@ te , a high-@@ profile partner , not only for friends but for the whole of society .
teaching does not always have to be penalised , restricted , for@@ b@@ idden , forced to order , con@@ qu@@ ered , wh@@ i@@ pped away in the media &apos;s stig@@ ma by lo@@ ading them .
the teacher must set an example .
a poli@@ cy@@ man who is sitting is talking about tobacco losses ?
a poli@@ ce@@ man exceeding speed will punish me for being too quick ?
and , then , between my colleague with his head ...
I have the ri@@ ot idea that perhaps we should try to bring the ruling class around once .
tell them not to run in secret .
drin@@ ks , drin@@ k in public : in a squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling , in the eyes of the whole people .
to force speed to over@@ run in public only - the cars of the ru@@ lers , including private cars , be they red .
if you rule , then govern as if you govern y@@ ourselves .
maybe then the shame is enough if words and actions fail .
or can we know that we ourselves want to be governed by those most ab@@ hor@@ rent .
because all of us , the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans , are the ones that we do not want to be at all at all .
where do you fle@@ e your own way ?
this weekend allows rain to occur , which is why it is a good time to take up one decent trend .
why not tri@@ m@@ ming@@ s .
&apos;@@ R@@ E g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous &apos; shares recommendations for nine habits , which should help you to achieve more secre@@ tive and better ton@@ es .
it is claimed that the first changes should be seen after the first tran@@ che week !
a bus driver saved eight months from the motor@@ way without knowing that the do@@ gs actually have the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I put these eight months in , I would have been wh@@ i@@ pped up by a woman , along with a do@@ g , and a jo@@ ke was made by a bus driver O@@ le@@ g , who got round the clo@@ th@@ es of a crow@@ d with no ex-@@ post surveillance by the vehicle , hand@@ ing them over to the asylum worker .
however , asylum was soon revealed by the ow@@ ner of the do@@ g , for whom it was incomprehensible why the images were taken away from his home .
the bus driver of Char@@ go@@ land , O@@ le@@ g , has said that he has worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s , but this has not been the case before in his career : &apos; I travelled by bus to 14@@ 6 of my traditional route .
near Har@@ t@@ on-@@ Ris@@ k , I noticed that there is something small running around on the road .
I thought it was a hand@@ sha@@ ke , but it turned out to be just four cu@@ t@@ ons &apos; , a bus driver reminded us .
he got a gri@@ p and stopped a bus full of passengers in order to pick up the scen@@ es .
&apos;@@ H@@ on@@ oura@@ ble , cars would have over@@ run them and had their do@@ gs cro@@ ssed &apos; , said O@@ le@@ g .
he added that passengers were reasonable and that soft do@@ gs were also offered to them with great pleasure .
the gu@@ ess initially fea@@ red slightly , but then became a pleasure .
on board , the bus driver went to a new front because the timetable needed to be followed .
once again , by travelling through the in@@ vention of the pu@@ pi@@ es , he saw a further four small do@@ gs there .
it was a German sheep do@@ g .
they were so prompt and it was immediately apparent that they had been looked after .
the do@@ gs were nice , down@@ right shocking .
the first point , of course , was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason , and the bus driver said that , for that reason , he decided to po@@ cket co@@ ac@@ hes .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me take those four months and ap@@ pealed to the police &apos; was a reminder of O@@ le@@ g .
law enforcement officers conta@@ cted T@@ all@@ in@@ na on animal asylum , the staff of which came to the co@@ ff@@ ers according to the Baltic plant .
but was a bus driver not temp@@ ted to take a k@@ it@@ ty for himself ?
that was the point .
one Ko@@ so@@ po@@ ly was so beautiful and peaceful .
the sitting was nice like an adult do@@ g &apos; , said O@@ le@@ g .
but where do I put those eight cu@@ d@@ g@@ el@@ s on my head ?
I would have been ex@@ pelled by a woman , along with her do@@ gs .
we still have a small child .
to take the b@@ os@@ s &apos; , he added .
Ms To@@ bi@@ as , the President of A@@ nim@@ al Asylum , confirmed that asylum was indeed granted to 8 German sheep do@@ gs , who are two and a half months old .
on the same day , however , the ow@@ ner gave in to the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il family .
&apos;@@ We did not even in@@ sta@@ ll these images and gave them them back in the same way &apos; , he stated .
&apos;@@ The ow@@ ner of the do@@ g was not very an@@ no@@ yed , but he said that they had the only place of sight and that the bus driver could have asked whether the images belong to them &apos; , said To@@ bi@@ as .
however , the as@@ y@@ lu@@ m-@@ man@@ ager added that , at the same time , it is good that the bus driver dro@@ w@@ ned the river bas@@ ins on the road and did not happen to this end .
in fact , it was very good from the bus driver that he reacted .
the landscape has met where , if necessary , traditional vehicles simply cannot get off the hoo@@ k with the best will .
that is where the A@@ TV will be the solution .
the A@@ T@@ V , which is used in the military field , gave an overview of the tas@@ te home !
there is nothing new in the military use of such vehicles with ligh@@ t@@ weight and good penet@@ ration capacity .
the need for them arose even during the Second World War , but more attention began to be paid to them a decade later .
simpli@@ city and strength
as far back as 195@@ 6 , M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 , which was known as the M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 me@@ tho@@ di@@ cal O@@ ver@@ land plant , had developed further development from a vehicle designed to eva@@ cu@@ ate the vulnerable in the final years of the Second World War .
for the way forward , it is a little strange to say a little bit strange to spe@@ ll out the me@@ cha@@ u@@ vin@@ ist mu@@ le .
a more per@@ me@@ able vehicle is hard to imagine .
a wh@@ eel@@ chairs platform , a job and a ro@@ t : everything , all of the luxury .
as soon as super@@ flu@@ ous construc@@ tors had rus@@ hed the lines too has@@ ti@@ ly off the des@@ k and started production quickly .
however , in a war , what counts is much more per@@ me@@ able than comfor@@ t .
there was no opposition to the slu@@ dge put to the test in this category in the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese j@@ ung@@ le .
it was a little easy to escape , less than a hundred kil@@ o@@ gra@@ m machine , to pa@@ int them in places where the W@@ ill@@ y@@ se Y@@ e@@ p , who met with his super@@ -@@ dig@@ it@@ isation capacity , was supposed to display the brak@@ e .
vehicles with almost 500 kil@@ os of power were used for transport purposes , both po@@ pp@@ y and mercury .
at times , ligh@@ ter , un@@ set@@ tling anti-@@ tan@@ k weapons were also f@@ itted with the other side .
however , such a tru@@ ck came down , and that still happened , it was possible for the driver to shift the ro@@ ol@@ ing system forward in the latest trouble and get it so far down that it was possible to drive the vehicle in the th@@ in blocks .
the units were produced until 19@@ 70 , to@@ tal@@ ling 11 2@@ 40 , and were w@@ o@@ e@@ fully used up until 19@@ 80 , as a result of a race against the H@@ M@@ W@@ s .
in the next two decades , the A@@ T@@ R had a rather marg@@ inal meaning in military cir@@ cles .
they came back to the picture after they fell in New York , and US soldiers found themselves bu@@ ried in the deser@@ t landscape of Iraq and Afghanistan .
it was there that the knowledge and the idea that what was needed was something that would bridge the gap between the H@@ um@@ we@@ e and the anti-@@ personnel force .
since AT@@ V@@ s do not generally offer considerable protection , they are not exactly the best option for directly tackling the challenges .
what is more , fast and ligh@@ t-@@ touch mach@@ ines are suitable for carrying out specific tasks .
for example , in re@@ con@@ na@@ is@@ san@@ ce and rescue operations .
today , the American army uses thousands of A@@ T@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ V@@ s .
most of them , like the X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 50@@ s bu@@ ried in the defence union , are basically identical to those in the civil turnover but supplemented in accordance with the needs of the army .
the comments received by the K@@ aw@@ as@@ a@@ ze company will be represented by names such as the K@@ aw@@ as@@ ak@@ le Mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ dt and Fo@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ ah@@ ka R@@ hin@@ o and Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c C@@ a , and the ever-increasing choice of the leading military producer of A@@ T@@ V@@ s &apos; Pol@@ ar@@ is models .
in 2013 , the Pol@@ ar@@ i concluded a five-year agreement with the American Special For@@ ce Centre ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) for supplying the tw@@ in M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ R@@ R@@ R@@ R@@ 4 , and provided for a separate five-year contract for M@@ 8@@ 50@@ s made by the Pol@@ ar@@ is S@@ por@@ ts@@ man base , which has both ra@@ pe@@ p@@ pi@@ c and b@@ la@@ ck@@ -@@ val@@ ry , and provides for innovative urban mobility . we can also after the tab@@ oo of 50 c@@ ali@@ b@@ re weapons .
before entering the M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 market , M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 from the Pol@@ ar military reached their supply .
in the case of M@@ V@@ 700 , there is a military version of the Pol@@ ar@@ is 7@@ 00@@ c T@@ w@@ in S@@ por@@ ts@@ man , which has been included and wanted by v@@ ines , a two-@@ part fuel tan@@ k for major distan@@ ces , a reinforced iron and north , and some more military equipment not to provide any more for farmers or co@@ us@@ ins in the same forest .
in the same way as John De@@ ere M@@ -@@ G@@ os@@ ta@@ tors , who has been successfully used in Iraq and in Afghanistan , are equipped with armed streng@@ ths , b@@ agg@@ age sto@@ res and some other elements that are useless in ran@@ king sho@@ cks but necessary in the battle zone .
a vehicle weigh@@ ing 750 k@@ g can bear almost the weight of its body , in other words , 5@@ 70 k@@ g .
engine capacity will also be enough to carry out ligh@@ ter after@@ -@@ cuts and me@@ ga@@ -@@ sli@@ pped parts .
the changing vision of the back part , which is to be removed , will make it possible to drive the b@@ agg@@ age of A to B , which is quanti@@ fied by the little but wh@@ im of the in@@ sec@@ ts .
later on , A@@ 1 , supplemented by M@@ -@@ G@@ ind@@ i , was prepared by 20 hor@@ ses more than the original 20-@@ strike M@@ -@@ G@@ ator , and the subsequent strengthened framework A@@ 2 , which is even better for managing and pu@@ mp@@ ing , and A@@ 3 , which comb@@ ines A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 &apos;s positive properties .
the fire bri@@ ga@@ des actually received in Bosnia as long ago as 1997 and 1998 , where medical bri@@ ga@@ des used them to eva@@ cu@@ ate the w@@ ounded .
at the same time , they also reduced the burden on their own mobile soldiers by carrying a degree that otherwise the pe@@ at would have had to pay .
if the majority of the A@@ T@@ V@@ s used in the power structures are mo@@ dal@@ ities for vehicles used in civil consumption , there are also a few exceptions .
the most outstanding of these are the war@@ fare bearing the name of P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International , Pro@@ w@@ ler , which has been successfully used throughout the world for all kinds of bat@@ tle@@ - , intelligence and rescue missions .
according to the manufacturer , for the first time , 10 years ago , bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks have been reported for the vehicles that have been set up to carry out specific operations , typical of the A@@ T@@ V@@ s that are used and also of those mo@@ del@@ led for the army , both for man@@ ager , resistance and for safety .
being similar to normal AT@@ V@@ s from construction and beyond generation , Pro@@ w@@ ler is bru@@ tally different in terms of both his construction and his capacity .
it is quicker , more du@@ rable , more stable and able both to dra@@ g on and bear greater difficulties than other , similar vehicles .
for example , if , in the case of the ordinary AT@@ V , the driver constantly has to play with his body in order to maintain the vehicle balance and use both hands to manoeuvre , to speed up and to put a brak@@ e on both hands , the management of the Pro@@ w@@ ler is more like driving a car .
however , in the end , it makes no difference whether the concept and use of Pro@@ w@@ ler , G@@ ator , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or another AT@@ V - all of them have the same characteristics .
and it is clear that , in the circumstances in which defence expenditure is being sought to be reduced broadly and the smaller , fu@@ gi@@ tive , targeted and ligh@@ t-@@ duty ligh@@ t-@@ duty vehicles are being prac@@ tised instead of broader conventional wars , it is an army that is ligh@@ t-@@ weight and quick to remain in the service .
&apos;@@ M@@ y &apos;@@ clo@@ ck died , but I did not &apos; maintain a huge s@@ mi@@ le in the I@@ ron@@ man 7@@ 0.@@ 3 fin@@ ishing .
it is true that , in the course of a whole half-@@ long trialogue , the p@@ ound on the R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t did not sh@@ y away .
what is more , he had 21.@@ 1 kilometres running into the conver@@ sation b@@ et : &apos; I spoke to a man during a drin@@ k , a man wal@@ ked away and won@@ dered : &apos; I@@ ss@@ and , you were still talking &apos; .
at the do@@ g distance Ra@@ iv@@ o , who had had had the energy conver@@ ted to drin@@ k , went a few times to wal@@ k fast .
at T@@ re@@ en@@ en &apos;s suggestion .
&apos;@@ A@@ AL@@ A@@ R Ju@@ h@@ ans@@ on said that there is no point in forcing drin@@ ks , because there are such increases here and there is little point in time about whether drin@@ ks or motor@@ way wal@@ ks , &apos; the actor says that he he@@ eded the words of the ad@@ vis@@ or .
he was also able to catch his b@@ reat@@ h at the wal@@ king times , and so after crossing the fin@@ ishing line , he was also able to share un@@ brea@@ th@@ ed left and right inter@@ views .
as if there were no 1.@@ 9 kilometres of sw@@ im@@ ming , 90 kilometres of motor@@ ing and 21.@@ 1 kilometres of drin@@ k behind us .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I think my training is also to be able to enjoy this competition &apos; , admit that in January , the boo@@ k@@ ings have started and are now em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in 16 k@@ g &apos;s dis@@ conten@@ ted slu@@ ms with the loss of Ra@@ iv@@ o .
and , as far as inter@@ views are concerned , that was my wish for me to be able to give an inter@@ view after the fin@@ ishing .
I have been able to give inter@@ views following every competition , and I had hoped that it would be nice to go on with O@@ te@@ m@@ n@@ ä I@@ ron@@ man as well .
I thought that it would be all very well if I was not on the west ba@@ g after I@@ ron@@ man ; contrary to the be@@ ating pat@@ ch@@ work of the west ba@@ th@@ ine , Ra@@ iv@@ o fin@@ i@@ ch@@ mark offered a completely different picture : &apos; T@@ w@@ o fin@@ ishing the sky &apos; and m@@ oul@@ ding a sincere jo@@ y &apos; .
there was reason to do so : R@@ ai@@ vo@@ l took 46 minutes for 1.@@ 9 kilometres and 24 seconds , 90 kilometres for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 minutes for running a kilometre of 2 hours and 18 minutes .
&apos;@@ M@@ y heart has now been given to the Tri@@ at@@ on &apos; , and Ra@@ iv@@ o , who was already in the final boo@@ m , is confir@@ ming that he had given a finger to sport , and that took the finger at the tax@@ i .
I have already registered myself behind the T@@ all@@ in@@ st F@@ on@@ d@@ o of 20 August - 2@@ 30 kilometres behind the T@@ all@@ in@@ st T@@ oh@@ p@@ se !
so , again tomorrow , I have to keep up my momentum !
the third f@@ esti@@ val day of the Weber will be sent by a strong wind .
in this way , one of the w@@ o@@ es who tries to fly from Tu@@ rin to the cap@@ tain was thrown in the eye by the ac@@ id light .
in the future , many of the f@@ esti@@ vals say that you and your eyes are full in the s@@ and .
I think we have gone quite well .
we have done a good job of work and work &apos; , Mr S@@ human man , the P@@ u@@ t@@ t police leader , will say how they have had the ref@@ e@@ re@@ e of the first two days of night .
he says that , even today , there are pat@@ rol@@ s police and rapid reaction in the streets and also communic@@ ating with people - that is to say , they have questions and they also want to know how to get a rapid reaction .
in two days , the police have had to deal with some bat@@ tles and also drug cases .
&apos;@@ there have also been some drug handling of a large amount of nar@@ co@@ tic substances , but summar@@ ies when We@@ k@@ u@@ n is over &apos; , S@@ man says .
about a hundred people have gone through the P@@ u@@ t police station in two n@@ ights .
fortunately , the police have not had to resolve the extre@@ mes .
by the way , S@@ human being says that if you have to hate from the sky dras@@ tically and horiz@@ on@@ tally , there is not much work for them .
a head of the Iranian police has once said that ra@@ inf@@ all is like extra staff .
the wa@@ i@@ ter police have also provided , in the We@@ e@@ me@@ al area , with sta@@ ple help , where the things that have been found can be brought to and where the missing things can be called .
by the way , the police even lost one of the things they needed , whose good people had inven@@ ted .
look at the video that And@@ res S@@ human he@@ ik@@ i still spoke about .
the Weber f@@ esti@@ val Bal@@ tic@@ u b@@ os@@ s G@@ un@@ na@@ r Vi@@ es talks to a fire that the f@@ esti@@ val first obtained Finland years ago and its owners went to watch the coast under the Ri@@ ia for enlargement , while the shel@@ ter was stopped in P@@ ä@@ n@@ us and sold in Estonia on the f@@ esti@@ val of such a f@@ esti@@ val .
G@@ un@@ na@@ r says that they have committed 25 000 visitors a day , but the chic@@ k@@ ens are only coun@@ ted when the f@@ esti@@ val ends .
the preparation for today &apos;s celeb@@ ration has already begun in September .
&apos;@@ We had the information by cities that last site starts construction , there is a ho@@ tel &apos; , G@@ un@@ na@@ r is talking about the change that she had to face this year .
there is no K@@ op@@ pa at the moment , but it is my belief that if the K@@ O@@ P@@ P did not go this May , the next thing will be .
so perhaps as a woman we should have relo@@ cated somewhere &apos; , he explains why f@@ esti@@ val has moved this year .
the organisation of the F@@ esti@@ val is going to be around for a year .
people are working in the We@@ e@@ w between a thousand and a half thousand - police officers , management team , volunte@@ ers , traders , security teams and so on .
the most difficult thing to do , according to Vienna , was to have the du@@ o T@@ he Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ kis .
after all , men are now an un@@ disputed figure in the po@@ pp@@ y world .
why it was difficult for H@@ he Cha@@ in@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ er@@ s to have a Weber and how G@@ un@@ na@@ r comments on the fact that two artists cancelled their representa@@ tions are already looking at video .
the s@@ na@@ p@@ shot in Estonia is coming from the West .
in North Estonia , there have already been voices of noise on several sides and individual concessions .
this afternoon , the no@@ d service also issued a warning .
today , it is mainly in North Estonia that there are several h@@ ives .
the pic@@ tures are moving quickly from the West to the east .
&apos;@@ N@@ u@@ cle@@ ar-@@ wind@@ s in the in@@ ner land amount to 15 , islands and 18 m / s , but the sun may come from stronger wind@@ s &apos; , is standing on the website of the weather service .
however , a much bigger ther@@ mal storm is ra@@ ging in the south-@@ east of Finland and Russia from S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg to the east .
fortunately , however , the wind is b@@ low@@ ing from the West and the East in Estonia , so there is no risk , at least for the time being , of more stor@@ ms turning to Estonia .
the F@@ in@@ ns organised a dance gu@@ n for their men .
when the first male bo@@ ys were held in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is 11 years ago , the organ@@ ise@@ rs probably did not forget that the northern neighbours were leading by the small Est@@ onian city .
today , however , in the west of Finland , the first Finnish male dance plant is being held in La@@ pu@@ a .
&apos;@@ The representatives of the town of La@@ pu@@ a were so enthusias@@ tic about the mas@@ ters in the last tw@@ in@@ ning city of R@@ ak@@ al@@ es that they wanted to do something similar themselves &apos; , reported by R@@ ak@@ ver &apos;s ab@@ il@@ in@@ na@@ te head , K@@ ai@@ r Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is what is happening today in Finland on the La@@ pu@@ a was@@ hing machine at the Finnish 100 celebra@@ tions , Mi@@ es@@ -@@ T@@ ans@@ si@@ pi@@ do , where there is also 100 men from V@@ ir@@ u@@ land &apos; , S@@ t Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k said .
as Pi@@ h@@ let says , this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two tw@@ in@@ ning cities .
it also marks the years of the Jewish Republic of Estonia and Finland .
there is also a missile among the S@@ t@@ anding man of 69 survi@@ v@@ ors of the upper and previous season at Kar@@ l Re@@ in@@ k@@ u@@ b@@ la .
&apos;@@ I@@ f I have the honour of being one of the hundred men who , with their participation in Finland , show what Vic@@ u men are able to do &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ R@@ ac@@ ever@@ e dan@@ cing men have all set out their own excessive working order in the preparation of the Finnish men to show a decent level for the northern neighbours &apos; , and A@@ in S@@ k@@ ar@@ mine , a member of the R@@ ac@@ ver City Government , also commen@@ ted on the undertaking .
as a whole , the presentation of the men from V@@ ir@@ u@@ country has put the dance pillar T@@ ar@@ van@@ p@@ ä@@ ki , the artistic leader , on Tibet , together with the well-known com@@ patri@@ ot , E@@ lo Re@@ e@@ o@@ ja .
Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans are based on a fron@@ t-@@ load scheme .
the first Est@@ onian male dance plant was organised in 2006 , while the latter was in R@@ ak@@ al@@ is in 2015 .
although the media &apos;s attention has mainly been focused on the Hol@@ y Fa@@ ther and the Weber going on there , this is not the only music factory in this weekend .
the In@@ ci@@ k@@ er@@ my f@@ esti@@ val , which is taking place in the be@@ er region , also has loy@@ al f@@ ans .
one of them wri@@ tes , for example , in T@@ wit@@ ter : &apos; I sold the We@@ e@@ me@@ al ticket so that I can go to In@@ ci@@ re@@ t &apos; .
and why not .
in addition to the domestic artists , there are also speakers from America , Finland , Lithuania , Hungary , England and elsewhere .
the f@@ esti@@ val organ@@ iz@@ ed in the world forest also sur@@ prises the doctors there due to the location of the ma@@ gic w@@ and .
one of them today , Lu@@ cas Ro@@ se , could not wonder how beautiful Estonia is in T@@ wit@@ ter .
but visitors , too , have not been narrow in the distribution of intermediate ad@@ missions .
in order to be able to take part in the campaign for In@@ ci@@ k@@ er@@ my f@@ esti@@ val , look at the g@@ alle@@ ries too !
although this is over the weekend , your practice has not sub@@ si@@ ded .
there is still a hand@@ ful of work , and you are also trying to urge other people to act fast .
concerns could be forgotten and a more expensive exit vehicle could be seized .
take the time for yourself to enjoy one another &apos;s company in a flou@@ ris@@ hing , ro@@ man@@ tic place .
speaking on the subject of war , you have to bur@@ n your way , you have big plans , or you will for@@ give promises ... which a moment later you have thought of .
the other party , however , rec@@ alls your words .
it is perhaps a bit un@@ set@@ tling to be a gu@@ est , and it is difficult to focus on any action .
your sense of self-@@ estee@@ m may not be dependent on what is happening now , but on what has happened in the past .
also , if you get into a difficult situation , you could act quickly and pru@@ d@@ ently .
you may be helping someone out of the w@@ o@@ e today , because you have enough wisdom and determination .
rather , it leaves concern for monetary and business affairs .
it takes time to rest and rela@@ x .
dealing with a P@@ op@@ ula@@ r cause may be ti@@ re@@ less and may be ner@@ v@@ ous .
it is possible that this has ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tally turned into a serious dispute in which you have to defend your views for@@ cefully .
if others go across the border , then you can go down that road .
let us be better known in the normal environment , doing things that you know and that offer jo@@ y .
you are probably not bo@@ wing to new knowledge and ad@@ venture .
speculation is an activity that you will probably never be full of content .
today , too , you are bur@@ ying your company .
what is happening on the f@@ ence may not , however , be business as usual .
it may be that , despite a free day , you still have to deal with the g@@ las@@ ses .
or there was physical presence at home , but thought at the des@@ k .
if you want hard accommodation , you can offer it travel .
in the middle of the ad@@ venture , you are absor@@ bing you , you have to pull together to keep the wave and keep your balance .
waste energy to debate money .
we will only take up this issue if the situation really requires urgent and decisive intervention .
in Indon@@ esia , a man who st@@ ole@@ n three com@@ po@@ sers from the mos@@ que was bur@@ nt alive is being bur@@ nt by the Hungarian news agency M@@ T@@ I .
the 3@@ 0-@@ year old shadow sh@@ ou@@ ted off the city of Be@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in the vic@@ in@@ ity of the capital city of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 1 August with com@@ po@@ sure , but the sole@@ mn guard observed him and the sil@@ ver : &apos; take the thi@@ ef ! &apos;
the State of T@@ ul@@ d@@ i was helped and immediately reco@@ vered .
it es@@ ca@@ ped a motor@@ cycle and even floo@@ ded the river .
the cost of the ba@@ il-@@ out las@@ ted a few kilometres , then one stra@@ w thrown into the back yard was hit , causing serious injuries .
the bo@@ ge@@ y@@ man hun@@ g on its head got off the hoo@@ k and be@@ a@@ ten him over .
one of the off@@ spring sp@@ il@@ led over the gas and forced him to bur@@ n .
Sy@@ rian died of inc@@ iner@@ ators at the scene .
the body was transferred to the Eastern J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta police hospital .
the police seized their property not only with a motor@@ b@@ ike but also with st@@ ole@@ n power .
the local press initially revealed reports that it was not an asset but rather an electric mon@@ ster who wanted to bring about the re@@ pa@@ iring of the com@@ po@@ sers .
however , these arguments were decisively dis@@ proved by the police .
the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen reports that it did not make a statement on what happened .
the D@@ P@@ A , the German news agency , estimates that this step is due to the fact that the In@@ dependent have little confidence in the police and the judicial authorities .
Indon@@ esia is the largest Islamic country in the world .
of the 2@@ 55 million inhabitants , Muslims are as high as 8.@@ 2 % .
multi@@ ph@@ ra@@ ses affected by the clo@@ th@@ es of Est@@ onian children are affected .
while in Europe and America , children are often sha@@ ped by the children of the K@@ ing families or gl@@ ori@@ fication , Est@@ onian parents choose clothing on the basis of what is going on in the c@@ in@@ em@@ a .
British little P@@ rin@@ ce Ge@@ or@@ g is becoming a real mo@@ gu@@ r@@ u with the mother , her@@ t@@ so@@ g@@ in@@ na C@@ ah@@ ter@@ ine .
like her mother , the P@@ rin@@ ce can un@@ le@@ ash in people &apos;s clo@@ th@@ es a real purchasing ma@@ dness , which has even become a separate concept : the P@@ rin@@ ce George effect .
the last of these epis@@ o@@ des took place a few weeks ago , during a visit by the K@@ ing family to Poland , where George k@@ ni@@ fe in the Spanish br@@ and Ti@@ z@@ as 10 euros paid by the S@@ ig@@ -@@ red parents bu@@ ried in an e-@@ bo@@ y in 24 hours .
the sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers from Estonia probably did not have much , because the squ@@ ab@@ bles of the K@@ ing &apos;s children allegedly leave our parents completely cold .
Anna An@@ s@@ mit@@ t , the head of communications in the F@@ re@@ ight , re@@ alises that the Stalin@@ ist couples &apos; children and foreign mo@@ ed@@ it@@ ors in general do not affect our parents &apos; purchases to their m@@ ou@@ ths .

at the same time , he confirms that , if he so wishes , he will be able to put his children in line with the P@@ rin@@ s or P@@ rin@@ ce of Europe .
the man was held hostage by a mo@@ del@@ le plan to sell him down on the web .
in Italy , a Polish citizen took the British motto hostage .
the plan was for a 20-@@ year-old woman to place an online fer@@ ry on the Internet , in other words , en@@ c@@ rus@@ hed to au@@ ction , was reported by Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
the police reported that a woman was lu@@ red to Mil@@ an on 11 July with a promise that she would get a photo@@ g@@ raph .
instead , he was s@@ tun@@ ned and brought to light near Tu@@ rin .
it was claimed that imprisoned women tried to sell their women on a dark web for GBP 2@@ 30 000 , and submitted a ran@@ so@@ m procurement demand to his mo@@ del@@ ling agency .
however , he was put in prison by a woman on 17 July by a British consu@@ late .
according to the police , the Polish citizen , Lu@@ k@@ u@@ z Her@@ ba , is in doubt , who lives in Britain .
according to the newspaper Cor@@ ri@@ ere del@@ la Ser@@ a , the man found that a abduc@@ ted woman had a small child and did not want to sell him as sex sla@@ ves .
the results of the pro@@ p@@ he@@ ma@@ tics of the depart@@ ment revealed the delicate data of vulnerable children of neg@@ li@@ gible vessels .
as a result of a worrying breach of information , personal data on neglected children , including information about whether they are sexu@@ ally active , has been mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly sent to one child &apos;s mother .
a table with e-@@ mail containing the names of all children in the care of a large service provider in the town of Vic@@ tor@@ ia , bir@@ th@@ day , location and related specific concerns and atten@@ dan@@ t places was sent to his mother .
the e-@@ mail revealed the place of life of every child .
the list points out that a 13@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y is exempt from ba@@ il and sexual behaviour manifes@@ ts that a 15@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l with problems of self-@@ inju@@ ry , abuse of certain substances and dra@@ in@@ age is &apos; without bo@@ y friend &apos; and &apos; no s@@ mi@@ les tonight &apos; and that a 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y needs help with his or her care and is ver@@ bal and aggressive .
the table appears to be a transfer document designed to send an observer in the night exchange .
the document contains notes as to when some children can wait home or whether they can contact the staff in order to catch up .
there are wor@@ ry@@ ingly many details of some children .
with regard to the 15@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y , it is written with warning : &apos; if the staff are in contact to obtain permission to examine the do@@ g and / or the lap@@ top@@ s / U@@ S@@ B for revision because of the suspicion of un@@ suitable sexual material , this authorisation must be granted &apos; .
the document also states that a 17@@ -year gir@@ l who gets 18 in just three months &apos; time and is being fre@@ ed from a welfare institution is in danger of being subjected to suicide tests of such magnitude that the staff will have to call on the emergency when he is fleeing immediately .
for a 16@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y who was released , it was noted that he was out and &apos; later conta@@ cted the staff in order to catch up &apos; .
although , in the case of the places listed , only the name of a accommodation unit where children are held and not their address is mentioned , there are still enough details to be found .
the data she@@ et in 2015 came out when the mother shared with F@@ air@@ fa@@ x ME@@ D@@ AS her experience in the health care and service minis@@ try and child protection sector , starting with her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter in the care four years ago .
he agreed to share his concerns now that his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had received 18 and leaving the system .
the hear@@ t-@@ breaking decision to hand his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter before the protection of children was made after a violent incident at home , a case which is one of the more and more complaints of domestic violence brought by parents against their children .
this had worrying consequences that the mother could never have predicted ; for example , she was able to get a da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter six months after leaving her house after leaving seven criminal charges , she was relo@@ cated to hundreds of kilometres away into a house and an environment where she seemed to be able to survive successfully , and then she was returned without informing her parents , accepting and facilitating her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter care for her tw@@ in relationship between her mother and her two da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters .
the relationship with the first of those bo@@ y friends , with the age of 17 , with whom a woman was regularly allowed at that time at a 15@@ -year da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter in a local ho@@ tel , ended when a young man was presented a few days after the age of 18 because of that relationship was accused of taking a child into sexual relations .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y did he leave the system in a worse situation when he went into it ? &apos; ask the mother .
&apos;@@ and will this happen to all care@@ less children ? &apos;
he is very much in favour of setting up an institution which will allow children to be tra@@ ced in the first few weeks at the health and service minis@@ try before they are relo@@ cated to their homes .
this would enable them to understand better how children intera@@ ct with others and what the dangers and needs are associated with them , particularly in educational terms .
the government of the state is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in their home welfare by seeking , among other things , to better support their parents .
with a clear guide@@ line line for assistance packages financed over four years with USD 62 million , the aim is to help trans@@ mit children into situations of better organisation than care at home .
in addition , the EUR 5.@@ 6 million two-@@ year experim@@ ent , which was published last October , will enable professional carers to be provided to at least 28 children to help them get out of care or to avoid them coming into it .
according to the depart@@ ment spokes@@ man , the information lea@@ k was not officially reported when it happened , although the mother claims that two depart@@ mental workers were informed within a few months of the incident .
a depart@@ ment is now working with a service provider to analyse the case .
&apos;@@ every lea@@ k of alleged private data is taken very seriously and we will work to ensure that it has not had a negative impact on the young people concerned &apos; .
in July last year , the Minister for Fam@@ ili@@ es and Chil@@ dren , J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ ik@@ a@@ kos , ordered an independent review of the incident on the privacy of child protection during a five-year period .
the depart@@ ment agreed with seven recommendations as a result and has subsequently updated the Code of Protection for Chil@@ dren to ensure that the staff clearly understand their roles and privacy procedures , changed IT systems to ban the automatic concentration of certain personal data , and formally examined the services related to the privacy of the depart@@ ment .

Vietnam &apos; regre@@ ts &apos; Germany &apos;s accus@@ ation of kidna@@ pping .
Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m said on Thursday that he regre@@ ts the comments made by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs accus@@ ing the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese intelligence service of the kidna@@ pping of a former Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese oil tra@@ der , who is reco@@ vered because of accusations at home .
the German authorities believe that T@@ rin@@ h X@@ u@@ an T@@ han@@ h was taken along from Berlin , which left Vietnam &apos;s a@@ x@@ les on Wednesday 48 hours to leave the country .
T@@ han@@ h faces ac@@ qui@@ es@@ c@@ ence charges with the death penalty in the event of a conviction .
he sought asylum from Germany , but his statement had not yet been worked through when the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese authorities called for his extradition .
the representative of the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese Foreign Minister , Le T@@ hi Th@@ u Han@@ g , said to re@@ por@@ ters that these comments were &apos; extremely regrettable &apos; and that T@@ han@@ h gave himself to the police in Vietnam on 31 July .
&apos;@@ Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m always sets great store by and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany &apos; , he said without going into detail .
T@@ han@@ h , 51 , disappeared last July after it was initially charged with dis@@ honest management at the National H@@ an and Ga@@ y ty@@ re of Pet@@ ro@@ Vietnam , which caused losses of around USD 150 million .
the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese police issued an arrest warrant in September .
in March , the police initiated an investigation into the em@@ anci@@ pation of his alleged involvement in the property project .
T@@ han@@ h was the Chairman of Pet@@ ro@@ Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m Con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ti@@ on Jo@@ in@@ t Sto@@ ck Cor@@ por@@ ation until 2013 , when he was appointed to the government for several senior posts , including De@@ puty Chairman of the province of Ha@@ u Gi@@ ang del@@ ta in the south .
he was elected to the National Assembly in May 201@@ 6 , but was released from a legislative body dominated by the Commun@@ ists before the first month of the session .
he was also ex@@ pelled from the Communist Party .
the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese A@@ mb@@ assador in Germany was invited on Tuesday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him that Germany was calling for T@@ han@@ h to be returned so that asylum and extradition procedures can be implemented correctly .
the results of the investigation show that prin@@ ter material is also spreading se@@ eds .
prin@@ ter se@@ eds are also spreading like bir@@ ths and m@@ am@@ m@@ als .
these in@@ sec@@ ts are known mainly as la@@ g@@ un@@ da@@ go@@ ers helping to dem@@ ol@@ ish substances that are reco@@ vered from the forest .
the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is are also helping to dis@@ per@@ se the se@@ eds .
Japanese scientists discovered that prin@@ ted car@@ ro@@ ts have an important role to play in the distribution of se@@ eds at Mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ tru@@ m , the wild wild mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ tru@@ m .
it is an unusual plant .
it does not include a ch@@ lor@@ ine , so it is not capable of photo@@ syn@@ the@@ sis .
instead , the species will receive its nutri@@ ent mix@@ tures grown bene@@ ath its surface .
T@@ ai@@ m po@@ ds small fra@@ gran@@ ces and po@@ ta@@ to@@ es on forest grounds .
Vil@@ ja@@ il has very little or no tas@@ te , and Japanese researchers found that poultry and m@@ am@@ m@@ als are not interested in them as a source of food .
only a hand@@ ful of sp@@ ine@@ less consumption of fruit and forest prin@@ ted B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p@@ pon@@ ica was the only species that regularly visited fruit .
investi@@ g@@ ators looked at the issue of prin@@ ter dro@@ w@@ ning in order to as@@ certain whether these in@@ sec@@ ts help spread se@@ eds .
scientists found that an average of three so@@ ap@@ s were found to be fed every grain after they had been fed .
further tests confirmed that the majority of se@@ ed se@@ ed was viable .
scientists assume that this unique plant elite has probably learned to make use of the ability to spread prin@@ ted se@@ eds during evolution .
we acquire the skills close to the ground and they will be ready at the same time as the prin@@ k@@ lers get out of their vas@@ s@@ als .
investi@@ g@@ ators published their findings in the B@@ ot@@ an@@ ica J@@ our@@ nal of the L@@ in@@ ne@@ an Soci@@ ety this week .
&apos;@@ Gi@@ ven that around 4 600 prin@@ ted rooms have been identified so far , the distribution of se@@ eds through prin@@ ted ra@@ ins may be much more extensive , and so far just an un@@ documented mechanism , not just the unique ability of a particular plant block to exploit prin@@ ted pr@@ inc@@ s &apos; , said in a press release including Professor of the University of Na@@ o@@ to Su@@ gi@@ ur@@ a , K@@ um@@ am@@ o@@ to .
&apos;@@ It is hoped that public brea@@ d will encourage people to pay more attention to inter-@@ plant and prin@@ ted relationships and to look for further examples of how prin@@ ted se@@ eds spread &apos; .
the F@@ ly@@ so-called report on the disclosure of improved information , which shows additional payments .
Michael F@@ ly@@ so-called , who served for a short time as an advi@@ ser on national security , submitted on Thursday a report on the disclosure of improved federal financial information containing new details of F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s transfer of tru@@ mp@@ s to presidential office , an I@@ ra@@ q@@ -@@ American business@@ man and a fac@@ t-@@ of-@@ the-@@ euro campaign with the parent company .
in a letter which sent information with improvements , F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called stated that his initial information disclosure reports were submitted under fast-@@ tra@@ cked conditions without the usual consultation and supervision provided by the Val@@ ge Ma@@ and lawyers and the government &apos;s ethical office .
according to the letter , the F@@ ly@@ so-called &apos; part &apos; did not receive the attention given to others , as he was no longer a worker from the White House at the time .
F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ished his post just 24 days after taking office in the middle of rum@@ ours that he had given misleading information to Vice-President P@@ ence about his post-@@ election ties with the Russian A@@ mb@@ assador in the United States .
F@@ ly@@ so-called also attra@@ cted criticism for cross-border payments during work in the private sector following the dis@@ mis@@ sal of the Director of the Defence Agency in 2014 .
in an information provided previously by investi@@ g@@ ators in the House of De@@ pu@@ ties , F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called declared that , in 2015 , around USD 68 000 were paid and paid by entities linked to Russia .
in addition to the income related to Russia , the information on Thursday revealed that F@@ ly@@ so-called had received at least USD 5 000 for a consul@@ tan@@ cy service for a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East .
the F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n work on the project was published earlier , but it was not known that he was paid for it .
the renewed information also confirms that the F@@ ly@@ so-called had agreed to cooperate with the S@@ C@@ L Group - at that time with the British parent company of C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge An@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ a - that is , the D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp@@ i campaign .
C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge De@@ part@@ ment , one of the main donors of hedge funds , Robert L@@ . mer@@ cher , whose da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Re@@ be@@ ka@@ h is an influential Conservative financial supporter .
Washington Po@@ st announced in February that the F@@ ly@@ so-called salary was the S@@ C@@ L Group ad@@ vis@@ or .
according to those who know his role , F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n &apos;s aim was to help the US subsidi@@ ary to win new public contracts with the United States .
at the same time , the head of the efforts to conclude public contracts was asked by the government of a former colleague from F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n from the government of a national po@@ em .
